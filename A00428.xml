            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Auguſtin ſaith of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilicall Philoſophers &amp; heretiks they come to kill, &amp; deſtroye.</p>
            <p>Iuſte in this manner doth it paſſe with the teachers &amp; eſtablishers of the new Religion in England. They veſte themſelues with sheeps skins in that they make profeſſion of reformers of the Church, but vnder the ſpecious &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant color of reformation, they deforme all true Religion, &amp; faith, &amp; virtue. King Henry the 8. altho' he was not of this Religion which is at this preſent profeſſed &amp; practiced in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, yet was hee the firſt that opened the way vnto it, &amp; this vnder the color of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: an yet what monſter was euer more deformed then hee? he was <hi>vniformiter defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter deformis,</hi> deformed I meane both with in &amp; without, both in bodie &amp; ſoule. What a rauenous wolfe was hee? Howe manie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17282:3"/>conuents, &amp; monſteries did he deforme deface &amp; deſtroye. What a number of religious perſons did he turne to the wyde world to lead an irreligious life, expoſing them to the breach of their ſolemne vowes to God.</p>
            <p>Finally what a generall libertye did he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, both in faith &amp; manners, in all ſortes of people, he him ſelfe being the maſter of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule &amp; ringleader to all licentiouſnes.</p>
            <p>And according to this begining, his ſonne &amp; ſucceſſor did continue, who altho' his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares &amp; weaknes of bodie did not permit him to imitate the vices of his Father, yet had he tutors &amp; protectors that were not farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde their old maſter, neither in corruption of faith nor manners. Whoe ſeeking for new Euangeliſts in forraine countries, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de Bucer, Martir, &amp; others whoes fingers tickled to be working in the newe harueſt, who coming in to the countrye &amp; finding the people generally inclined to libertie eaſily made their entrance into change of Religion, &amp; ſo in a shorte tyme vnder the plauſible title of reforming abuſes in the Church, they introduced a forme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion neuer heard of in England as neither in the reſt of the Chriſtian world in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: &amp; thus promiſſing Chriſtian libertie they intruded an vnchriſtian corruption both in doctrine &amp; lyfe, making by that meanes of an ill begining in the Father a worſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17282:4"/>in the ſonne. Which ill begining &amp; continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (excepting that religious interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Queene Maries tyme) had a yet more vnchriſtian progreſſe in the Reigne of Queene Eliſabeth, who not content with the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings eithers of her Father or brother in that nature, but adding euill to euill for politique ends, as not houlding her ſelfe &amp; Crowne ſafe except she did firſt extinguish the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Realme, by reaſon of the knowne flawe of her title, she inacted thoſe ſeuere lawes againſt both Catholike Clergie &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which haue ben ſtill executed by her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; iltho' throu' the naturall clemencie of our preſent ſoueraine, not in that ſanguinarie manner that then they were put in practice &amp; execution.</p>
            <p>And thus I haue ſignified in breefe the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, continuation &amp; progreſſe of the new profeſſed faith in England, which notobſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it carieth with it neuer ſo glorious a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of reformation, yet is it but a new fashion framed mierly for the profit &amp; conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of the inuentors, &amp; to pleaſe phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, &amp; curious itching wits, &amp; myndes incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to libertie: And ſo daylie altering as newe fashions in apparell vſe to alter, by diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence it will at leingth vanish away &amp; turne to the old fashion againe, I meane to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion moſt vniuerſally euer profeſſed

And in the ſecond chapter of his booke of the vnitie of the Church; he ſaith, that our ancetors cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (the Church) Catholike to the end they might shewe by the name it ſelfe that she is in whole. In like manner Vincentius Lyrinenſis in the third ch. of his booke, to the vniuerſallity of the Church ioyneth conſent, or vnion. And Venerable Bede vpon the 6. chap. of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles affirmes that the Church is called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, <hi>quia per omnes mundi partes in vnapace, in vno Domini timore aedificatur.</hi> That is, becauſe it is planted or built in all partes of the world in one peace, &amp; one feare of God. And thus it plainely appeares that the worde Catholike, or vniuerſall, whatſoeuer els it includes, yet it muſt of neceſſitie haue vnitie in that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie which it ſignifies.</p>
               <p>This being ſuppoſed as a trueth which euen our aduerſaries cannot reſiſt. I proue againſt them firſt that there is no vniuerſallitie in the matter or obiect of their Religion, with this argumentation following.</p>
               <p>All religions which are not one, &amp; the ſame in matter or obiect which Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles preached, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te vniuerſallity in obiect, or matter.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:17282:8"/>
               <p>But the Religion profeſſed in England at this preſent, is not one, &amp; the ſame in obiect or matter which Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Religion profeſſed in England at this preſent wantes vniuerſalitie in obiect or matter.</p>
               <p>The maior of this Sylogiſme is iucluded in the ſuppoſition before declared at the leaſt in parte: &amp; graunted euen by our aduerſaries as I ſuppoſe, it being nothing elſe in ſenſe, but onelie that the particular obiects or matters which a Catholike or vniuerſall beleeuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth by faith; are one, &amp; the ſame doctrine in euerie point, which God hath reueiled, &amp; the moſt vniuerſal Church propoſeth to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all perſons in the vniuerſal orbe. And this appeares moſt true eſpeciallie if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the doctrine or obiect or anie Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot be conceiued to be vniuerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be taken in this forme &amp; manner, in regard that in this ſorte, &amp; not otherwiſe, it attracteth or draweth vnitie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the founder, &amp; ſo hath the propertie of being one, without which vnitie it cannot poſſible be one and the ſame in manie, in which neuertheleſſe the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nature or eſſence of vniuerſalitie conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Now touching the <hi>minor</hi> or ſecond propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſame Sylogiſme, I proue it in this manner; firſt, becauſe the Religion which our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17282:8"/>Saulour, &amp; his Apoſtles preached was vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie, &amp; indiſtinctlie one &amp; the ſame both in matter &amp; forme, I meane both in obiect or matter of faith, &amp; in the aſſent of faith itſelfe, &amp; therefore the Apoſtle Epheſ. 4. as he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes there is one onelie Lord or God, ſoe doth he in the ſame tenor affirme there is one faith. <hi>Vnus Dominus, vnafides:</hi> meaning that faith is one as well obiect as in acte. And yet this is otherwiſe according to the doctrine of the English Church, whoſe profeſſors diſtinguish the obiect of their faith, in to fundamentals, &amp; not fundamentals; which diuiſion of theirs cannot poſſible ſtand with vnitie, as both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon and common ſenſe moſt plainelie teach: And conſequentlie the matter or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect of the English faith cannot be one, &amp; the ſame with the obiect or matter of that religion which Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles deliuered to the vniuerſal world, in which true Religion there is no parte nor partial which is not truelie and propethe fundamental, &amp; to be vniformelie, &amp; vniuerſallie beleeued vpon for feture of eternal Saluation, according to that formidable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſupreme Iudge himſelfe who without anie diuiſion or diſtinction pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſentence of condemnation againſt all ſuch who obſtinatelie erre in their aſſent of faith to anie matter by him,

A matter ſo cleare &amp; manifeſt by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of all hiſtories both of thoſe former times &amp; ours; that I neuer heard of anic of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, who either in writing, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate diſcourſes, or publike ſermons, hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie auerred it to haue ben preached with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption euer ſince the time of Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles.</p>

               <p>And thence it proceeds that for the auoiding the force of this or the like probation, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not what other refuge they can haue then to ſay, that notobſtanding the obiect or matter of their Religion neyther is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor hath ben in all precedent ages taught or preached: yet that in reſpect their Religion is the ſame which was preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp; their ſucceſſors in the firſt fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares after the lawe of Chriſt, it may be tearmed vniuerſal in obiect or matter euen at this preſent, eſpeciallie ſuppoſing it is not the multitude of beleeuers which makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or matter of Religion vniuerſal, but the totalitie, or latitude of the doctrine it ſelfe, as being in all points the ſame which Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuered to his Apoſtles to be preached to all nations.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17282:11"/>euidentlie appeares that the English Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath no ſuch relation or reſpect vnto all future times intrinſecallie included in it obiect, or matter: or if anie reference it had, it was of ſuch temporarie, &amp; ſmale conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance that it quite loſt it by the way in all that vaſte ſpace of time which paſſed betweene the Popedome of ſainct Gregorie, &amp; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie of Martin Luther.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I yet farther adde, that the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the English faith aſſume falſe &amp; abuſe their hearers when they ſo commonly affirme that their Religion is the ſame which was taught &amp; preached by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, which I proue becauſe it doth not indeed agree in all particulars with the obiect &amp; matter of the faith &amp; doctrine which Chriſt &amp; his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles published to the world as manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by comparing ſome ſeuerall points of them both &amp; conferring the one with the other. For where can the noueliſtis finde either in the ſcripture, Fathers, or authenticall hiſtorie that Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles taught that thoſe onely bookes of ſcripture ar Canonicall which the Church of England holdes for ſuch? or that Chriſtians ar iuſtified by that faith onely by which they beleeue their ſinnes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted &amp; the iuſtice of Chriſt applyed vnto them by the faith ſame, &amp; that euerie one in particular is bounde ſo to beleeue, &amp; that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17282:11"/>this faith onely is neceſſarie &amp; ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? or wher doe they finde that Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles preached that the onely written worde is neceſſarie &amp; ſufficient to ſaluation? where doe they reade in ſcripture or Fathers that the viſible Church planted by Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the preaching of the Apoſtles, &amp; continuated by a diſinterrupted ſucceſſion of Paſtors can erre in faith? that ther is no Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, nor place of ſatisfaction either in this world or the next for leſſer ſinnes, or the paine due to greater? or that in the Sacrament of Euchariſt the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt at not contained &amp; receiued other wiſe then figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely &amp; by faith a lone? I knowe they can shewe vs none of theſe ſeuerall propoſitions either in ſcriptures, or doctors of the Church, or by anie authenticall hiſtorie or relation that the ſame haue ben taught by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. I am aſſured that all they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in this caſe, is to produce certaine textes of ſcripture which to the ignorant ſorte of people may ſeeme to haue reſemblance with thoſe their poſitions, but none ſoe plaine that without detortion of either ſenſe or wordes or both, or without their owne fallatious illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; conſequences, can poſſible containe anie ſuch doctrine. For example for their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidian iuſtification or their iuſtification by faith
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17282:12"/>onely, they alledge diuers paſſages out of the epiſtles of S. Paule, as that man is not iuſtified by the workes of the lawe but by faith, &amp; that faith is reputed to iuſtice, &amp; yet none of thoſe shewe that faith onely iuſtifies &amp; much leſſe doe they mention or inſinuate that peculiar faith of remiſſion of their ſinnes by which the profeſſors of the English Religion beleeue they ar iuſtified: that which is euidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the tenor of the texts then ſelues in which neither of the partes of the former po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is contained but added by the expeſitions &amp; gloſſes of thoſe who violently drawe the ſcripturs to their peruerſe purpoſe. And the like practice of the Nouelliſts may eaſily be diſcouered to be vſed in the reſt of the ſeuerall propoſitions aboue rehearſed, in Bellarmin &amp; other Catholike Controuertiſts, who profeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly confute the newe doctrine of the ſectaries of this preſent age to whom I remit the reader for more exact diſcuſſion of the ſame, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this place is vncapable of more large proceeding.</p>
               <p>And hence it appeares that the profeſſors of the English faith muſt needes confeſſe that according to the premiſſes here breefely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; confirmed the matter &amp; obiect of their Religion doth not agree with that doctrine which Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; published, which is the Minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17282:12"/>of my ſecond ſilogiſme aboue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punded, &amp; the verie ſame I here intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince. And now to the confirmation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I reſponde: I graunt the multitude of beleeuers doth not cauſe &amp; formally conſtitute vniuerſallitie in theobiect of Religion: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe if comparing one Religion wit an other it is diſcouered to be apparently certaine that the one hath euer had a greater multitude of profeſſors in all tymes &amp; places ſince the firſt fondation of the true faith, then the other, yea &amp; that the one hath had a greater number of faithfull perſons for manie ages together, when as the one had none at all: In this caſe I ſay it is manifeſt that the multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doth euidently argue the Religion ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued &amp; profeſſed to be no other but that ſame Religion which was firſt founded by Chriſt our Sauior with his promiſſe of perpetuall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie &amp; cantinuation; &amp; with multiplicitie of faithfull people, &amp; conſequently that it onely hath vniuerſallitie in matter &amp; obiect: &amp; that on the contrarie the other Religion which can shew no ſuch multitude of profeſſors, but is notoriouſly defectiue in this particular, hath not anie vniuerſallitie at all in the ſeuerall points of doctrine which it teacheth them to beleeue. And now this may ſuffice to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that ther is no vniuerſallitie to be founde in the obiect or matter of the English Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:17282:13"/>
               <p>The ſecond kinde of vniuerſallitie of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in tyme, which I proue not to be had in the English Religion in the forme fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

               <p>But the Religion of England hath not ben viſibly extant in all tymes ſince the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true Religion.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Religion of England wantes true vniuerſallitie of time.</p>
               <p>The maior is moſt certaine &amp; maintained by many of the profeſſors of the English faith if not by all. Yet becauſe they are not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited in this point as farre as I can perceiue by their doctrine, &amp; becauſe of thoſe whoe maintaine the viſibilitie of the Church, fewe or none of them graunt that the Church hath ben alwayes ſince the times of Chriſt ſo viſible as the Romaniſts hould it to haue ben, that is with viſible Paſtors &amp; teachers and a viſible flock or congregation of people aſſignable in all ages and times: therefore I will proue it firſt by plaine texts of Scripture, then by authoritie of ancient Fathers, &amp; firſt that the true Church is abſolutely viſible, then that it is perpetually viſible.</p>

Then I replie firſt; it is manifeſt that if ther be no prefeſſion of faith in neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, people, nor anie parte of the Church, then can it not poſſible be a true Church or the Church of the Predeſtinate as they will haue it, but a Congregation onely or companie of timerous &amp; cowardly people which dare not profeſſe their faith,
<note place="margin">Ore autem confeſsio fit ad ſalutim</note> &amp; conſequently not the Church of Chriſt in which not faith onely but alſo profeſſion of faith is neceſſarie to ſaluation according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle ſaying that, <hi>with the hart we beleeue vnto iuſtice,

               </p>
               <p>And howbeit I conceiue that the defenders of the inuiſibilitie may inſtance &amp; ſay that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith is not required to the eſſence of the true Church, &amp; by conſequence that it may ſubſiſt with internall faith onelie: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I reioyne to this, that althou' I should grant profeſſion of faith in metaphiſical rigor to be no eſſentiall parte of the true Church, yet is it ſo neceſſarilie annexed to the true Church as it neither is nor euer will be founde without profeſſors: neither is there anie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority either of ſcriptures or Fathers whereby it can be proued that anie ſuch true Church euer were or euer will be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of internall faith onelie. But all thoſe places which I haue aboue alledged both of the abſolute viſibilitie of the Church &amp; neceſſitie of profeſſion of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17282:16"/>faith to ſaluation required by the ordinance &amp; commaundement of Chriſt manifeſtlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the contrarie. Well may our aduerſaries out of their accuſtomed temeritie &amp; ſpirit of contradiction againſt the Roman Church, &amp; becauſe they haue no other meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſubſiſtance of their owne new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, affirme &amp; teach that internall faith alone without profeſſion makes a true Church yet no iudicious man will euer be perſuaded but that poſition is aſſumed by them mierlie for the aduantage of their owne ill cauſe which without the vſe of it or ſome ſuch other of like nature, cannot poſſible be defended in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie whether the true Church be ours or theirs. To omit that if no externall profeſſion of faith be required to the true Church, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceiue how anie man could euer come to knowe that ſuch a Church as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of internall faith onely, was euer extant in the world any in parte of time ſince it was once planted &amp; eſtablished by our Sauior &amp; his Apoſtles. And yet admit that it is not wholely impoſſible to conceiue the poſſibilitie of a true Church without the attribute of externall profeſſion, yet this is but a Metaphiſicall caſe grounded onelie in the diſcourſe of him who ſo conceiueth it, &amp; by conſequence it is not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for anie man to venture his ſaluation vpon it, as being either plainelie falſe in it ſelfe,

               <p>Now the foreſaid explication of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faries is alſo contrarie to reaſon. Firſt for that ſuppoſing Chriſt planted ſuch a Church vpon earth in which there were to be alwayes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible paſtors &amp; preachers to adminiſtere the Sacraments,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 1. Cor. 12. Act. 20.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17282:17"/>as the inuiſible Church if anie ſuch he had eſtablished in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondlie the ſame expoſition is againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in reſpect that by that limitation of our Sauiors wordes which our aduerſaries vſe, they giue vs to vnderſtand that Chriſt promiſſed much, but performed little or nothing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in this particular.

And if for the gates of hell to haue ſo fare much vrged &amp; vexed the Church as to haue le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An other pregnant place for the perpetuall continuation of the viſible Church, is that of the 4. to the Epheſians: where the Apoſtle ſaith that Chriſt appointed Paſtors &amp;c. <hi>Ad conſummationem Sanctorum donec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the conſummation of the Saints till we meet all into the vnitie of faith &amp; into aperfect man:</hi> That is vntill the day of iudgement. Vpon which place ſainct Auguſtin in his 12 booke of the Citie, hath large diſcourſes to this purpoſe in the 16.17. &amp; 18. chapters. And the trueth is that Chriſt himſelfe hauing in this ſpeciall manner deſigned ſuch perſons for gouernors &amp; teachers in his Church till the end of the world, doubtleſſe his meaning was not that they should be ſuch dumme dogs as the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishers of the inuiſibilitie doe affirme them to haue ben in their imaginarie Church for a long time together: But his diuine will &amp; pleaſure was they should be <hi>cuſtodes Ieruſalem qui tota die &amp; tota nocte non tacebunt in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum.</hi> That is Chriſt would haue them ſuch watchmen or keepers of Ieruſalem (that is to ſay the Church) as shall not be ſilent till the end of the world in no time, nor vpon anie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17282:18"/>Which perpetuitie of the viſible gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of the Church is grounded in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſts diuine prouidence &amp; mercie towardes the members thereof for whome of his infinitie goodnes he pleaſed to haue the way to ſaluation continuallie open: Which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the true Church had ben at anie time hidden or inuiſible as at the leaſt ſome of thoſe againſt whome I nowe diſpute will haue it, then it could not poſſible haue ben ſo: Yea &amp; manie thouſands or rather millions of men had liued &amp; dyed out of the ſtate of ſaluation as being impoſſible for them to finde &amp; enter into the true Church all that ſpace of time in which it is feigned by them to haue remained inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or out of knowledge.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the impugnation of that parte of our aduerſaries which defeds that the true Church is not perpetuallie or in all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of times viſible: the abſurditie of which doctrine diuers of the defenders of the English Church of later ſtanding aduertiſeing, &amp; alſo becauſe they find it not ſo plauſible to their auditors as they could wish, they haue ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon another courſe, indeuoring to shewo that the ſame Church &amp; Religion which is now eſtablished in England hath ben alwayes viſible in the world from the time of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles euen till this preſent: Which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding of theirs altho' it is much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17282:19"/>more difficult &amp; hard to be defended then the other now confuted, &amp; that by this meanes the maintainers of it doe but <hi>incidere in ſyllam,</hi> that is by auoyding of one incouenience they fall in to a greater: Yet becauſe they perſuade themſelues they come nearer to the marke of prouing their Church to be Catholike in this reſpect as well as the Roman Church hath euer ben, (which indeed they might performe if they were able truelie to proue their viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) therfore I will breefelie demonſtrate that they haue no ſuch viſibilitie as is neceſſarie to the conſtirution of the true Catholike Church as they pretend.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to come to the purpoſe &amp; the more clearelie to conuince my intent, I frame this Sylogiſme againſt the viſibilitie of their Church.</p>
               <p>That Church wantes perpetuall viſibilitie which cannot produce ſome viſible profeſſors of their doctrine in all points &amp; in all ages ſince the time of the Apoſtles till this preſent.</p>
               <p>But the Church of England cannot produce ſome viſible profeſſors of their doctrine in all points &amp; ages ſince the tyme of the Apoſtles to this preſent.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Church of England wantes perpetuall viſibilitie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> is not denyed by our aduerſaries, the <hi>minor</hi> hath all the difficultie &amp; that I proue.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:17282:19"/>
               <p>And <hi>inprimis</hi> that the defenders of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish faith can produce no ſcripture for this point is moſt certaine and euident for that this is onelie a matter of fact which ſucceeded ſince the ſcriptures were published. By occaſion of which the reader may note that thoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the English religion who in this manner defende the viſibilitie of their Church doe not proceed <hi>conſequenter</hi> to that other negatiue principle of theirs to wit that nothing is to be beleeued by faith but which is either expreſſely or by neceſſarie illation contained in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which generall rule of theirs in this caſe is manifeſtlie defectiue for that in it neither ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor deduction or conſequence of ſcripture can ſeruo their turne in this particular.</p>
               <p>And if they replie that they can proue their viſibilitie <hi>a priori,</hi> by ſcriptures by thoſe places which teach perpetuall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> viſibilitie in the Church, then I ſay that this is not the matter now in queſtion but a ſubtiltie to delude the reader, for the controuerſie is whether they can proue their viſibilitie a <hi>poſteriori,</hi> that is whether they can yealde vs anie authenticall profe or teſtimonie whenby it may certainelie appeare that the Religion now profeſſed in England hath ben in deed perpetually viſible in in all ages as the ſcripture &amp; Fathers aboue alledged affirme the true Church ought to bee, otherwiſe they doe onely ſuppoſe their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17282:20"/>Church is the ſame which is deſcribed in the ſcripture, but proue it not. Neither doe we aske them to she we vs that ſuch a Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ther is in the world as the ſcriptures doe mention, but we vrge them to demonſtrate that their Church in particular hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie or attribute of perpetuall viſibilitie as the ſcriptures requires to be founde in the onely indiuiduall true Church of Chriſt: &amp; till they can performe this they neither ſpeake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe of ſcriptures, nor ſatisfie vs in our demaunde.</p>
               <p>Wherfore I proue the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition of of the argument aboue framed, becauſe no authenticall hiſtorie can beproduced in which it is related that this Religion of England now commonly ther profeſſed, beleeuing &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that ther ar but 22. bookes of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſcripture onely. That they ar to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſpirit of euerie priuat perſon. That man is iuſtified by faith onely. That ther ar onely two ſacraments inſtituted by Chriſt. That the bodie of Chriſt is giuen, receiued, &amp; eaten in the Sacrament in a ſpirituall manner that is by faith onely: finally I ſay that for teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of that theſe &amp; diuers others of the 39. articles of the English Religion haue ben taught or preached in all ages ſince the tyme of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles in anie Kingdome, prouince, towne or yet in anie one corner of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17282:20"/>the whole world tho' neuer ſo abſcure, ther is not extant anie kinde of recorde: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is incredible in the higheſt degree that anie profeſſors of it can be produced in euerie ſeuerall age ſince the foundation of the true Church of Chriſt: for that if anie ſuch had ben in anie tyme or place for ſo long a ſpace together, it is as certaine as it is certaine ther hath ben in all that ſucceſſe of tyme ſunne, moone, &amp; ſtarres in the firmament, or fishes in the ſea, that ſome writer or other would haue made mention of the ſame. And if Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers be ſo curious &amp; exact in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ther was neuer anie conuenticle of ſectaries ſo ſmale or obſcure but it hath ben noted &amp; related by ſome of them, much leſſe could ſuch a Church as our English Nouelliſts pretend theirs to be, haue lurked ſo cloſſe as that no mention of it should be founde in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or recordes of former ages before the daies of Luther. It is not abſolutely impoſſible to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue that Chriſt might haue eſtablished an inuiſible Church in this world at the leaſt for a tyme, but that he should haue ordained his church with pertetuitie of viſible paſtors, &amp; yet that neither their names, ſeates, parishes, or any other monument of them either dead or aliue, can be produced to make it viſibly appeare that they were profeſſors in all points of the ſame Religion which now is profeſſed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17282:21"/>this I ſay is aboue all admiration neither can it poſſible ſeeme credible to anie ſounde vndeſtanding, on mature iudgment.</p>

               <p>By which and the reſt I haue deliuered, it is clearely conſequent that the English Religion (eſpecially if it be intended as it is ſingular &amp; different in diuers points from the reſt of the pretenſiue reformed congregations) cannot poſſible with anie coulor of trueth, be named Catholike or vniuerſal in number of perſons; ſuppoſing that according to the doctrine of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; the common acception of the worde among Chriſtians, this appellation or ſacred ſurname agrees onely to that Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which hath generalitie of perſons as well as of tyme, place, obiect or matter, which generalitie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not poſſibly be conceiued but in order or with relation to the greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17282:26"/>Wherefore if the Religion of England had ben the true faith of Chriſt doubtleſſe it would by the profeſſors of it haue ben long ſince ſo extended &amp; dilated that it should not need to be brought to thoſe ſtreits as to fetch their vniuerſalitie from the verie end of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly becauſe the nature of the Religion of England is ſuch that it hath no conuenient meanes for propagation of itſelfe in the whole world, inregard that thoſe to whome the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of preaching &amp; teach the ſame is committed, are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are all either actually tyed to wiues children, &amp; poſteritie or els liue in expection, &amp; &amp; deſire of thoſe temporall, or tranſitorie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, &amp; ſcarce euer dreame of extending their Religion farther then their owne ſeuerall Parishes: yea &amp; their doctrine it ſelfe teaches them that either they muſt all marie of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie as ſome of them maintaine, or at the leaſt that it is more expedient, &amp; ſecure for them to marie then to lead a ſingle life: ſuppoſing which particulars it is morally vnpoſſible for them euer to preach their faith to all nations (as Chriſt commaundeth) with ſuch clogges at their heeles as are wife, children, &amp; poſteritie.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie it is certainelie knowne that ſince the Religion of England was eſtablished in the forme &amp; manner that now it is in, the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it neuer went to ante foren nation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17282:26"/>to preach their faith, &amp; much leſſe haue they euer taken anie generall courſe for the conuerſion of infidels by anie miſſion of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or by other meanes. Or if anie of them haue trauelled into ſtrange countries (which are knowne to be verie fewe in number) it hath ben onelie, or cheefely for temporall reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects as for that they haue ben ſilenced in their owne countrie for preaching ſome extrauagant errours, or els for ſome other crime or publike offence committed; or perhaps ſome pore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benificed, ignorant, &amp; threedbare fellowes who for want of meanes to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, reſolue deſperatelie to trye their fortune in an other place onelie for that reſpect &amp; not for charitie or zeale of reduceing people to Chriſtian Religion.

               <p>Laſtelie I ſay that for the profeſſors of the English faith to ſay, that their Religion will be extended thro' the whole world before the day of Iudgement is mierlie their owne predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to which no man of mature iudgement ought to giue credit except they firſt proue themſelues to be true Prophets which in my opinion they can no more performe then they can proue the deſcent of their pedegree from ſainct Michael the Archangell. And thus we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee plainelie that the English Religion as now it is profeſſed being deſtitute of all meanes to propagate it ſelf: as hitherto it neither is nor euer was vniuerſall in the world, ſo neither can it be imagined with anie probable coulour of reaſon that euer it can poſſible in future
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17282:27"/>times come to be ſpred ouer all the nations of the whole world as according to ſcriptures &amp; Fathers the true Church ought to be, &amp; the <hi>mator</hi> of my former Sylogiſme doth affirme. And not to inſiſte anie longer in this matter, I in like manner proue the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition of the ſame argument by the ſame reaſons which I haue vſed for the proofe of the foreſaid <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> which if they be duelie applied to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Religion they will plainelie demonſtrate, that the Religion of England neither hath ben, is, nor euer will be preached &amp; published in all partes of the world &amp; conſequentlie that it hath not vniuerſallitie of place which is that which the concluſion of the argument doth containe.</p>
               <p>It is true I further conceiue that the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the English faith as men diſpoſed to cauille, may yet once againe replie, &amp; ſay that in regarde their Religion is the ſame with the Religion of the Apoſtles, therefore it hath the ſame vniuerſallitie which the Apoſtolicall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath.</p>
               <p>But to this I reioyne anſer firſte that I haue shewed before that the Religion now proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in England doth differ in diuers points from the faith of the Apoſtles, the particulars of which difference I haue before ſpecified, as is that of iuſtification by faith onelie, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all of the reall preſence &amp; the reſt.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:17282:28"/>
               <p>Secondlie I ſay that this replie is that kinde of abſurditie in diſputation which the Logitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s call <hi>petitio Principij</hi> that is, when that is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the diſputant for a true &amp; certaine Principle which ought to be proued as being the verie matter in queſtion, &amp; ſo this is onelie an euaſion of the aduerſarie which hath no more force them his owne authoritie giues it, which is none at all.</p>
               <p>And now by this &amp; that more which hath ben ſayd touching the vniuerſallitie of place &amp; perſons, it is moſt apparent that the English Religion hath no ſuch attribute &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie that it is defectiue in that nature.</p>
               <p>Wherefore hence I paſſe to the laſt gender or kynde of vniuerſallitie which is that of the generall rule of faith, of which there be two ſortes, the one is nothing els but the word of God as it is contained in the ſcriptures or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine &amp; Apoſtolicall traditions. The other rule is the viſible Church by whoſe authoritie we come to knowe certainely &amp; infallibly the true ſenſe of the worde of God, &amp; all thoſe things which his diuine maieſtie hath reuailed as matter of faith to be beleeued by all ſortes of people, or otherwiſe neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>

               <p>Now to come to the purpoſe, in that firſt foundation of faith which is the authoritie of God as he reuaileth matters to his Church, &amp;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17282:29"/>without which true faith cannot ſtand, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the English Religion agree with the Romaniſts, as alſo they agree with them in the firſt of the two rules, at the leaſt ſo farre as concernes this controuerſie, that is they hould Gods worde to be a rule of faith as the Roman Catholikes hould: But the difference is in that our aduerſaries will needs haue the worde of God to be the ſcripture onelie, &amp; that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the ſpirit of euerie priuate perſon who reades it, <hi>&amp; conſequenter</hi> they hould this onelie for their rule <hi>proponent</hi> by which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine authoritie is applied to euerie point of faith in the beleeuers.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrarie we Romaniſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue &amp; vſe the authority of the moſt vniuerſall Church as the infallible applyer of Gods reuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling veritie vnto vs in all matters of faith &amp; manners. And in this rule vpon which all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith dependes <hi>quoad nos</hi> that is for as much as toucheth the beleeuers or credents, I here proue that the English Religion wanteth this vniuerſallitie as well as the reſt of the obiect &amp; circumſtances aboue diſcuſſed the which I demonſtrate in this forme of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>That onelie proponent rule of faith his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall which is one &amp; the ſame in all or at the leaſt in the greater parte of beleeuers.</p>
               <p>But that which the profeſſors of the English
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17282:29"/>Religion hould for their proponent rule of faith is not one &amp; the ſame in all or the greater parte of beleeuers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> that which the profeſſors of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Religion hould for their proponent rule of faith is not vniuerſall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> of this Sylogiſme is euident by the definition of vniuerſall, which according to the doctrine of Philoſophers is one in all if it be taken in rigor of Logike, or as the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſitians vſe the worde. Or at the leaſt it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the greater parte if it be accepted onely in a morall ſenſe, as here I take it. From which declaration of the word vniuerſall is collected no leſſe cleare &amp; conuincent proofe of the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> propoſition which affirmeth that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent rule of faith in the profeſſors of the Church of England is not one &amp; the ſame in all, or yet in the greater parte of beleeuers. That which I she we firſt, becauſe the priuate ſpirit of euerie profeſſor of the English Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which is the onelie immediate rule of ſaith they profeſſe to follow in matters of faith as the verie ſounde of the worde doth declare, is peculiar to thoſe that haue it. &amp; not common to all, therefore it cannot poſſible be generall or vniuerſall.</p>
               <p>That the ſpirit by which the profeſſors of the English Religion interpret the worde of God is peculiar to ſome onelie &amp; not common
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17282:30"/>to all ſuch as exteriorly profeſſe the faith of Chriſt it is manifeſt in that it neither paſſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other countries with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie in all points of beleefe to all the reſt of the pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches as appeareth in the controuerſie of the real preſence with the lutherans, the inamiſſibilitie of grace,
<note place="margin">In his booke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Chriſtian Princes.</note> the point of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, free will with the Arminians: nay nor yet doth it agree with the ſpirit of all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of England it ſelfe, as both King Iames doth plainely ſuppoſe wher he graunteth ther ar manie Puritans in his Realme beſides Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts &amp; Proteſtants: &amp; alſo experinental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth manifeſt the ſame, it being certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely knowne &amp; generally confeſſed on all ſides that thoſe three ſortes of people be not gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one vniforme ſpirit, but euerie one by their owne rule of faith, the rule of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts being one &amp; common among them ſelues in all places of the world, but on the contrarie the rule of the Proteſtants, &amp; Puritans, being diuided &amp; ſeuerall both in their owne countrie &amp; out of it, both among themſelues &amp; alſo from the Catholikes whereſoeuer they be: which diuiſion both from themſelues &amp; others is an infallible argument that they haue no vniuerſallitie in their propounding rule of ſaith. That which yet more plainely appeares &amp; is confirmed by a worke lately published by a Proteſtant Doctor (his name I doe not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17282:30"/>remembers) who deſcribes ſeueral ſectes of Puritans or pure Caluiniſts all different both among themſelues &amp; from the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. Which diuerſitie of ſectes cannot ſtand without a different ſpirit or rule of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondlie I proue the ſpirit of the profeſſors of the English religion is not one &amp; the ſame in all or the greater parte of credents, becauſe it is not that ſpirit by which the viſible Church hath ben in all times, places, &amp; perſons ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely gouerned without interruption, <hi>ergo</hi> it is not an vniuerſall ſpirit but onelie particular &amp; priuate. The antecedent of this argument is certaine for that if it were the ſame, it would be founde conformable &amp; ſubordinate to the ſpirit of the greater parte of the Chriſtian Churches, &amp; the Religion of England would be agreable to the Religion of the ſame Churches both in doctrine practice &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, which neuer theleſſe we ſee to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie &amp; repugnant vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſpirit of the maintainers of the preſent Religion of England is not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the ſpirit of their anteceſſors for aboue nine hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeares together at the leaſt, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not vniuerſall.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17282:31"/>them ſelues who haue either expreſſely teſtified or at the leaſt not denyed but that in all this ſpace of tyme euen vntill the dayes of King Edward the Sixt which is not yet a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares, the Maſſe &amp; reall preſence was generally approued, the communion vnder one Kynde practiced, Altars &amp; pictures vſed in Churches with honor &amp; reuerence. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie &amp; prayer to ſaints taught &amp; allowed, &amp; finally all the points of doctrine &amp; manners betweene the Romaniſts &amp; Anglicans now controuerſed were publikly profeſſed, all which neuertheleſſe is at this time condemned &amp; quite renounced &amp; abandoned by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the preſent English faith. Of which both they &amp; we are eye witneſſes at this day. Which two things can not poſſible be done by one &amp; the ſame ſpirit of God in regarde they ar quite appoſite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictorie in them ſelues, &amp; conſequently the ſpirit of thoſe who profeſſe to tepugne to that ſame doctrine which they know &amp; acknowled their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to haue imbraced as ſound &amp; pious &amp; conformable to the worlde of God, ſo manie former ages ſucceſſiuely, cannot be conceiued to be an vniuerſall ſpirit, but priuate &amp; proper to them ſelues.</p>
               <p>Fourtly the ſpirit of the preachers &amp; teachers of the English Religion is quite different from the ſpirit of the doctors &amp; writers that haue
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17282:31"/>adhered &amp; abeyed the Roman Church, in euerie ſeuerall age, as is manifeſt to thoſe who read them &amp; compare their workes with the writings of the pretenſiue reforming doctors of our tymes the doctrine of thoſe that haue writ euen from the firſt Centurie of yeares imediately following the Apoſtles being ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckled with pietie &amp; deuotion towardes the ſaints in heauen &amp; eſpecially the virgin Marie, as their ſermons, Homilies vpon their feaſts, &amp; other their workes doe teſtifie, of which matter good ſtore is to be founde eſpecially in S. Baſil, Cyprian, Chryſoſtome, Hierome, Ambroſe, Auguſtin. Gregorie, Damacene, Bernard, &amp; the reſt of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuines which haue writ euer ſince, euen till this preſent tyme, in whome alſo ther is frequent mention &amp; comendation of miracles operated by the ſaints &amp; their reliques: none of which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars appeare in anie of the Writings of the profeſſors of the English Religion, but rather in their bookes &amp; ordinarie ſermons they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuore moſt erneſtly to perſuade the people that they ought not to hearken after anie ſuch matters, but hould them either for falſe &amp; ſuperſtitious, or at the leaſt for idle, ſuperfluous &amp; impertinent, &amp; ſo we clearely ſee by this that the ſpirit of the English profeſſors is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the ſpirit of the whole torrent of the moſt learned &amp; renowned men of all ages paſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17282:32"/>euen to this preſent day; &amp; conſequently it can not be generall, common or vniuerſall, nor a true ſpirit, except the owners of it will condemne the contrarie ſpirit of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, iudicious, &amp; pious men of all ages ſince the tyme of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles to haue ben falſe &amp; erroneous, &amp; theirs onely the reight ſpirit of God. Which is the higheſt degree of temeritie that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>Laſtely. In practice of virtue &amp; exerciſe of good life the ſpirit of the preachers &amp; teachers of the English Religion now profeſſed, is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the practice &amp; exerciſe of virtue of the doctors &amp; paſtors of the Roman Church in all ſucceding tymes ſince the firſt foundation of the ſame: a great parte of whoſe writings ar replenished with rules &amp; driections for prayer &amp; contemplation, mortification of the bodie &amp; inordinate paſſions of the ſoule, by faſting, vſe of hereclothes, diſciplines, proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, acts of obedience, &amp; reſignation of their willes to the commaunde of ſuperiors, vowes of obedience, chaſtitie &amp; pouertie, monaſticall inſtitutions, ſolitarie life of monkes, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites &amp; Ermites, &amp; other Religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentuall men &amp; women, &amp; finally with all other meames which poſſible could be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as either neceſſarie or conuenient for the exerciſe of a religious &amp; virtuous courſe of life. None of all which or at the leaſt verie little is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17282:32"/>to be founde in the bookes of the teachers of the English Religion, or heard in their publike ſermons or priuate exhortations.</p>
               <p>And altho' it is true that ſome of them as it ſeemes moued with emulation of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts (who euen in this preſent age labore much in that kinde as our aduerſaries cannot denie) haue published ſome thing in the nature of prayer or deuotion, yet is it in ſuch a manner as they reduce the exerciſe of a Chriſtian life ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the exerciſe of faith onely or cheefly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding or at the leaſt not inducing to externall workes of Pennance and mortification of the bodie. Or els they proceed in ſuch a newe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion (as being onely ſutable to their owne newe Principles of faith &amp; manners) as neuer was heard in anie age of the world before the dayes of Luther.</p>
               <p>That which doth particularly appeare in a certaine newe worke lately published &amp; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. The handmaid of pietie, which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hath not one dramme of true pietie or one ſparke of that ſpirit which hath reigned in the viſible Church ſince the the firſt plantation of Chriſtian Religion: which booke not obſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it hath the name of a Mannuall yet is it not conforme either to the Mannuall of S.

               <p>And that which is more vntolerable the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane miniſter with his feruor &amp; deuotion he now &amp; then mingleth a lye or a paradox. As page 617. where ſpeaking of the faſt of lent, he affirmes. That thoſe of his profeſſion place not Religion or the ſubſtance of Gods worship in faſting or feaſting, as ſaith she the Papiſt, doe. And in the page following he ſaith in his owne name &amp; in the name of his brother Purita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. We hold not faſting to be a worke pleaſing to God. And yet in his page 609. he grautes that to faſt religiouſly at ſome time is Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And pag. 611. that lent faſt is partely religious &amp; ordered by the Church for religious endes &amp; bindeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience mediately: which larring poſitions of this grand Doctor I am not able to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile. And yet for a parte of twelfe dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he putteth the payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of tithes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far more profitable to himſelf
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17282:33"/>then pleaſing to others. All which particulars doe manifeſtly declare that whatſoeuer apish imitation theſe fellowes vſe in writing ſome fewe bookes of deuotion &amp; prayer, yet is their ſpirit quite contrarie to the common ſpirit of the vniuerſall Church, &amp; wholely vertige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, extrauagant, &amp; peculiar to themſelues.</p>
               <p>And to this the like may be added of their Church ſeruice &amp; forme of adminiſtration of Sacraments as may be ſeeme in their booke of common prayer, which, as it manifeſt to them that read it, doth notably differ from all the Lyturgies &amp; publike formes of prayers &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorals that euer were vſed in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preachings of Luther, not onely in the manner of adminiſtrating the Sacraments and ſeruice, but alſo in ſome ſubſtantiall points of them both.

               <head>THE SECOND PRINCIPAL ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>MY ſecond principal argument which proueth the falſitie of the English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is this. That Religion is falſe which hath a falſe or at the leaſt an vncertaine Canon of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>But the Religion of England hath a falſe or at the leaſt an vncertaine Canon of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Ergo the Religion of England is a falſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17282:35"/>Religion. The Maior doubtleſſe is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our aduerſaries. The <hi>minor</hi> which they denie, I proue. And for the proofe of it I ſuppoſe that the true Canon of ſcripture can not be knowne but by ſome externall authoritie or meanes diſtinct from it ſelfe whether it be the iudgement of euerie faithfull perſon aſſiſted by the diuine ſpirit as manie of our aduerſaries affirme, or whether it be the declaration of the Church aſſiſted by diuine inſpiration of which it shall be diſputed in an other place. More ouer theſe meanes or this authoritie muſt be infallible otherwiſe it can ingender no ſuch certainetie in the myndes of the beleeuers tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the matter in queſtion, but they would remaine ſtill doubtfull of the ſame. And the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for which this externall authoritie is thus required to the knowledge of the iuſte quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the written worde of God &amp; for the diſtinguishing of the true partes of the ſame from the Apochrypha &amp; doubtfull, is becauſe that as the ſcriptures doe in no places affirme &amp; declare them ſelues either in totallitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>This being now ſuppoſed as certaine on both ſides, I proue the foreſaie <hi>minor</hi> to wit that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17282:35"/>the Church of England hath a falſe, or at leaſt an vncertaine Canon of ſcripture by an other ſilogiſme in this manner.</p>
               <p>That Canon of ſcripture is falſe, or at the leaſt vncertaine which diſagreeth from all other Canons that euer were in anie Chriſtian Church before the dayes of Luther.</p>
               <p>But the Canon of ſcripture vſed nowe in England is diſagreeable to all other Canons that euer were in anie Chriſtian Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dayes of Luther.</p>
               <p>Ergo the Canon of ſcripture vſed nowe in the Church of England is a falſe or at the leaſt an vncertaine Canon.</p>
               <p>In the Maior of this ſilogiſme ther is no doubt. The <hi>minor</hi> I proue by comparing the Canon of England with thoſe ſeuerall Canons which according to the diuerſitie of opinions in that point among ſome of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in former tymes, ar founde to be three in number, howbeit of thoſe three ther was one which was euer more commonly receiued then the reſt, to wit that Canon which in the Councels of Florence &amp; Trent was defined to be infallible &amp; is that ſame which at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Roman Church vſeth reiecting all other for Apochryphall &amp; inauthenticall.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt of thoſe three Canons or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of diuine volumes conſiſteth of thoſe bookes of which ther was neuer anie doubt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17282:36"/>made but that they be ſacred &amp; Canonicall. The ſecond order is of thoſe of which ther hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n alwayes doubt neither hitherto ar receiued by the Church, to wit, the third &amp; fourth bookes of Eſdras &amp; the third of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabies. The third order containeth thoſe bookes of which ther hath ben doubt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tymes. Which ar Heſter. Iudith Tobias. The two firſt bookes of the Machabies. The Eccleſiaſticus, the booke of wiſdome &amp; the Prophet Baruch. Which belong to the old Teſtament. And in the new Teſtament the epiſtle to the Hebrewes. The epiſtles of S. Iames &amp; Iude, the ſecond of S. Peter, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond &amp; third of S. Iohn with his Apochalips.</p>
               <p>Nowe that the Canon of the Church of England doth not agree with the firſt order conſiſting of ſuch bookes of ſcripture as of which no doubt hath ben euer made, it is moſt euident for that in their Canon of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is included the booke of Heſter of which doubt hath ben made by Melito, Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzene &amp; S. Athanaſius: &amp; in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they admit the epiſtle to the Hebrewes &amp; the Apochalips (to omit others) of which neuertheleſſe doubt hath ben made, of the firſt by origen, &amp; of the ſecond by Euſebius, which was alſo quite omitted by Cyrill &amp; Nazia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>zene, nay &amp; that which is more to this purpoſe, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did expreſſely reiect them both with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of S. Iames.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:17282:36"/>
               <p>Touching the ſecond Order or Canon, ther is no need to bring anie proofe, in regarde it is well knowe that the Church of England doth not admit the two firſt bookes of Machabeis, &amp; much leſſe doe they allowe of the third as likewiſe neither they allowe the third and fourth of Eſdras.</p>
               <p>Laſtely touching the third &amp; laſte Order, they admit Heſter into their Canon as by the ſixt article of their new Creed doth appeare, but they reiect Iudith, Tobie, the Machabeis, Eccleſiaſticus, &amp; the Prophet Baruch: And yet as I ſaid before Heſter was doubted of at the leaſt by Melito, Nazianzene &amp; S. Athanaſius: &amp; contrarily of the booke of Iudith it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by ſainct Hierome that it is read to haue ben numbred or counted among the holie ſcriptures by the Councell of Nyce, which booke not obſtanding is expreſſelie excluded out of the English Canon of the old teſtament as the foreſaid article of theirs doth declare.</p>
               <p>And in the Canon of the new Teſtament they put the epiſtle of S. Iames &amp; Iude, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond &amp; of ſainct Peter, the ſecond &amp; third of ſainct Iohn &amp; his Apocalips, which yet in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times by ſome authors of accounte haue ben either quite excluded from the Canon, or at the leaſt held for doubtfull. So we ſee that our English profeſſors differ &amp; diſſent in their Canon from all the ſeuerall Canons of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17282:37"/>that either they themſelues or anie other can imagin to haue ben in the world in anie former age, yea euen from the Lutherans them ſelues whome neuertheleſſe they vſe to rancke among their brothers at the leaſt whenſoeuer they make for their purpoſe &amp; aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romaniſts.</p>
               <p>Further more if perhaps they ſay they haue the true Canon of ſcripture becauſe they haue the ſame bookes of the old Teſtament which the Iewes by infallible authoritie held for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall: And the ſame bookes of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament which the Roman Church houldes for Canonicall. Then I demande of them firſt how they come to know that their Canon is iuſte the ſame with that of the Iewes neither more nor leſſe, &amp; how they be aſſured that the ancient Iewes who onelie &amp; not the moderne Iewes, were the true people of God &amp; by him guided &amp; ruled, by what infallible meanes I ſay doe they knowe that thoſe Iewes excluded thoſe ſame bookes of the old Teſtament, out of their Canon as Apochripha which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church holdes for Canonicall? To wit Iudith, Tobie, Sapience, Eccleſiaſticus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabies. And I vrge them thus. Either they had that knowledge from the Iewes themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, or from the ſcriptures themſelues, or by tradition of the Church, or by the ſpirit or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God. From the Iewes they could
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17282:37"/>not poſſible haue certaine knowledge of the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that altho' their authority were once infallible in receiuing the true Canon of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either in itſelfe or by the aſſiſtance &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God: yet after the coming of Chriſt &amp; his eſtabliment of the Euangelicall lawe, that infallible authoritie of theirs ceaſed, &amp; ſo by them no infallible knowledge of Canonical ſcriptures could poſſible be from thence deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto the Church of Chriſt: Nay neither was it ſuteable to the dignitie of Chriſt &amp; his Church that the Iewes should interpoſe their authoritie in that nature.</p>
               <p>Secondlie from the ſcriptures themſelues it is cleare our aduerſaries could not receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledge of the Canon of the old Teſtament in the manner before declared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither the old nor new ſcripture doth teſtifie that thoſe onely bookes are Canonicall which the English Catalogue includes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe the writers of the newe Teſtament cite places out of thoſe bookes onelie, but alſo out of either all or at the leaſt ſome of thoſe which peculiarly the Roman Church aloweth for Canonicall, &amp; which I haue aboue rehearſed. For Eſter is cited by ſainct Auguſtin in his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to Edicia:

And yet I here deſire the reader to be aduertiſed that this which I haue vttered touching the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the English Canon of S.

Hierome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſeth in his Prologue, is not taken by him for the onely true authenticall Canon of the Chriſtian Church, but onely his meaning is to relate the number of thoſe bookes of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſcripture according to the moſt common opinion of the Iewes of his tyme. That which is manifeſtely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced by the authoritie of the ſame S. Hierome in the like caſe touching cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine chapters of the Prophet Daniel, of which altho' in his preface to that booke he once affirmed them not to be of authenticall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, yet afterwardes in his ſecond Apologie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17282:41"/>againſt Rufinus, he declareth his meaning in the foreſaid Prologue was not to ſignifie his opinion in that particular, but onely to relate the doctrine or ſaying of the Iewes. Now this being ſo, it is plainely certaine that our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of all the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers haue not as much as one S. Hierome vndoubtedly in fauor of their Canon, but onely the authoritie of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly our aduerſaries ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue recourſe to the ſpirit for the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the old Teſtament: firſt becauſe if they relie vpon this, they ought to proue it before to be the true ſpirit of God which moueth them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue their Canon to be of infallible authoritie, &amp; that either by ſome other Canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by ſome other conuincent reaſon or motiue as by miracles, ſanctitie, or by other externall teſtimonie, otherwiſe they them ſelues can neither ſafely relie vpon it, nor we can iuſtely giue credit vnto it, for that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declared in the authenticall ſcriptures them ſelues that ther be euill ſpirits as well as good by which men ar moued, yea &amp; that ſame ſpirit which ſeemes good is often tymes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered &amp; knowne to be the ſpirit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon animie who the more eaſily &amp; coulerably to deceiue &amp; delude, doth transforme him ſelfe in to an Angell of leight notobſtanding he is darkenes it ſelfe.</p>

               <p>More ouer for as much as concerneth the Canon of the new Teſtament, for our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to ſay they haue it from vs, is a verie pore shift, &amp; conſidering the want of authoritie which they hould to be in our Church as being in their opinion of no credit in other matters of faith, yea plainely erroneous &amp; Antichriſtian, it doth thence manifeſtly follow vpon their Principles that their Canon can not poſſible haue infallible certainetie in regarde that the whole grounde on which ſuch certaintie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende this ſuppoſed to be the authoritie of our Church which they neuertheſſe peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily auerre not onely to beſubiect to error, but alſo to haue alreadie erred in diuers points of faith.

But now this may ſuffice for examples of falſe tranſlation of the ſcriptures vſed by our aduerſaries, &amp; for the firſt proofe of the Minor of my ſilogiſme aboue framed.</p>
               <p>Which I further proue ſecondly for as much as concerneth the expoſition of the ſcriptures, becauſe the manner of interpretation which both our English profeſſors &amp; alſo the reſt of the pretenſiue reformers vſe, is ſcarce in anie thing coformable to the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers &amp; Doctors of the precedent ages as it ought to be according to the rule of S.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17282:45"/>the end of the ſame booke he addeth thus: that which they (to wit the Fathers) found in the church they hold, that which they had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Fathers, they deliuered to their ſonnes. But our newe interpreters as they are in their poſitions, ſo are they in their expoſitions of the worde of God ſingular &amp; full of affected apish imitation of the Iewish gloſſes: neither doe they ſcarce euer alledge anie other expoſitions or conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then thoſe of Rabbi Salomon. Rabbi Kimchi, Aben Ezra &amp; the reſt of that rabble. Notobſtanding they cannot be ignorant, but that ſome of them were either Scribes, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis, or Saduceis if not all, of whome it may be preſumed with reaſon that they frame their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions more commonly according to their owne falſe traditions the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the true ſenſe &amp; meaning of the lawe. By which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the reader may conſider how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is for our aduerſaries to ſatisfie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in the deliuerie of ſuch doctrine as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes vpon ſo vncertaine &amp; fayleable grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des; &amp; in how miſerable a caſe that flock is which hath his inſtruction in matters of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from ſuch Paſtors as partely out of the writings of thoſe profane Iewes &amp; enimies of Chriſt, partely alſo by their owne induſtrie coine new ſenſe out of the old, obſtruſe, decayed ſignifications of wordes which they find in pedantik humaniſts Lexico<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Dictonaries, neglecting the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <head>THE FOVRTH PRINCIPAL ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>MY fourth principall argument I propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the forme following.</p>
               <p>That Religion is falſe which hath a falſe rule of faith.</p>
               <p>But the English Religion hath a falſe rule of faith.</p>
               <p>Ergo the English Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a falſe Religion.</p>
               <p>The maior is not denyed by our aduerſaries &amp; therefore it needs no proofe: And it they should be ſo refractorie as to denie it: It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the verie leight of naturall reaſon which teacheth that the ruled followes the nature of the rule ſo that it cannot poſſible be ſtreighter then the rule it ſelfe, no more then a boton can be round if the moulde be ſquare.</p>
               <p>Now that the English Religion hath a falſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17282:46"/>rule of faith which is the Minor of my ſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, I demonſtrate thus by an other ſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</p>
               <p>The Religion of England hath for the rule of faith ſcriptures interpreted &amp; expounded by euerie particular member of their Church.</p>
               <p>But the ſcriptures interpreted &amp; expounded by euerie particular member of their Church, is a falſe rule of faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Religion of England hath a falſe rule of faith.</p>
               <p>That the ſcriptures expounded by euerie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of the Church is a falſe rule of faith I euidently proue, becauſe the true rule of faith is of it owne nature certaine, common, &amp; knowne to all beleeuers, not priuate, vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; certaine to him onely who hath it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe no man can certainely &amp; infallibly knowe what it is except himſelfe &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none but he onely can followe it: wheras the true rule of faith is ſuch as euerie one is bounde to knowe &amp; imbrace vpon perill of his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Secondly I proue that this English rule is falſe becauſe it is ſubiect to error the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of themſelues confeſſing that no man can infallibly interpreter the ſcriptures ſo that his expoſitions euen in the greateſt matters of faith be vndoubtedly true &amp; certaine in ſuch ſorte as he can infallibly perſuade others that they are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17282:46"/>according to that ſenſe which the holye Goſt intended when he dictated them to the diuine writers. For confirmation of which I further adde that our aduerſaries commonly teach that not onely euerie particular &amp; priuate perſon may erre in faith but alſo the whole number of Bishops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Prelates of their Church aſſembled in a Synod or Councell. Out of which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conſequent that their rule of faith is not certaine either in it ſelfe, or at the leaſt not to others: neither can others lawfully follow it for the ſame reaſon that it is vnknowne vnto them &amp; ſubiect to error, &amp; deceipte. Beſides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the profeſſors of the English Religion should denie this ſame,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> yet is it conuinced &amp; concluded by ſcripture it ſelfe ſaying, <hi>for what man knowes the things of a man but the ſpirit of man which is in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly if the English rule of faith were not falſe to wit ſcriptures expounded by euerie member of the Church, it would thence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followe that ther were no need of prechers &amp; teachers in the Church of England to propoſe &amp; declare the worde of God vn the people, becauſe euerie particular man &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that can read the Bible can ſufficiently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand &amp; expounde it them ſelues at the leaſt for as much as concernes their ſaluation. And for the ignorant ſorte which can not read, it were alſo in vaine for them to haue preachers
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17282:47"/>in regarde they can propoſe vnto them no other rule of faith then ſcriptures expounded by their owne particular ſpirit, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to their owne doctrine is fallible &amp; ſubiect to error &amp; by conſequence obledgeth no man to followe it but rather to auoy de it by all meanes poſſible.</p>
               <p>Fourthly I proue the ſame, becauſe this rule of our aduerſaries ſerues no mans turne but his owne who hath it, &amp; that but vnto wardely, neither doth it obledge others to beleeue it, neither is it one &amp; the ſame, but as manie as ther be people in the whole Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland all which is moſt abſurde &amp; repugnant to the nature of true faith which ought to be one in all the Chriſtian world, certaine, in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, &amp; binding all perſons to embrace it by diuine precept &amp; commaund which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe could not be ſuch if the rule which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth were not one without all multipllca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; diuiſion. And to this may be ioy ned for concluſion of the proofe of this argument that which I haue deliuered touching our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries falſe tranſlation &amp; erroneous manner of interpretation of diuine ſcriptures.</p>

               <head>THE FIFT PRINCIPAL ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>MY fift principall argument in order to proue the falſitie of the English Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is this.</p>
               <p>That Religion is falſe which hath not a perpetuall &amp; diſinterrupted ſucceſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops &amp; Preiſts deriued from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But the English Religion hath not a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall diſinterrupted ſucceſſion of Bishops &amp; Preiſts deriued from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Ergo the English Religion is a falſe Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> propoſition is ſo certaine and cleare that our aduerſaries a the leaſt all or moſt of thoſe of the Proteſtant faith can not denie it. And if perpaps anie of them or anie other Sectaries should be ſo frontleſſe &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to denie it, they ar manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by thoſe places of ſcripture which proue the perpetuitie of the gouernement of the Church of Chriſt in generall. As in the fourth to the Epheſians, where it is affirmed that <hi>Christ gaue to his Church Paſtors &amp; doctors that</hi> is Bishops &amp; Preiſts <hi>to the conſummation of the ſaints vnto the word of the miniſterit</hi> &amp; that to rule, gouerne, &amp; feed the flock of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17282:48"/>Church vntill the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummation of the world. And the Prophet Dauid in his 47. pſalme faith that God founded his citie (that is the Church as S. Auguſtin expoundes it) for euer. And ſurely if God eſtablished his, Church for euer as truely according to this he did: it can neuer wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Bishops &amp; Preiſts for that if it should wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them, then it were no more a true Church according to the ſaying S. Hierome. Wher ther is no Preiſt ther is no Church. In which word <hi>ſacerdos Preiſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contra Luciferia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</note> he includeth alſo Bishops as being cheefely Preiſts, &amp; thoſe without whome no Preiſts can be made of ordained. ſainct Cyprian alſo in the ſecond epiſtle of his fourth booke towardes the end teaches that the true Church cannot ſtand without Bishops &amp; Preiſts. And ſainct Auguſtin ſaith plainelie that it is the ſucceſſion of Preiſts (by Preiſts he meaneth alſo Bishops) which keepes him in the Church.
<note place="margin">Contra part. Donat.</note> And in his epiſtle 165. &amp; vpon the pſalme againſt Donatus, he chalengeth his aduerſaries the Donatiſts to number the Preiſts which haue ben euen from the ſeat of ſainct Peter, &amp; ſee who hath ſucceeded each other in that Order of Fathers, in which Order of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (meaning the Popes whoſe names he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiech in his epiſtle to Generoſus euen from S. Peter to Anaſtaſius who was Pope in his time) becauſe he findeth not one Donatiſt, therefore he concludes that their Religion is falſe &amp; not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17282:48"/>to be followed. So that the reader may plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie perceiue by theſe authorities (of which kinde manie more might be alledged if need were &amp; the place did admit anie larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) that the ancient Fathers held the want of ſucceſſion of Bishops &amp; Preiſts for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; infallible argument of the falſitie of that Religion which not obſtanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer other colores of truth it might ſeeme to haue by pretext of ſcripture or otherwiſe, was deſtitute of the ſame. That which is ſufficient for the proofe of the <hi>mator</hi> of my Sylogiſme in caſe anie of the defenders of the English Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion should haue the face to denie it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore hence I paſſe to the <hi>minor</hi> to wit that the English Religion hath not a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall &amp; diſinterrupted ſucceſſion of Preiſts &amp; Bishops derined from the Apoſtles, which I proue firſt: Becauſe it is certaine by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of all writers of thoſe ages that frome the time of ſainct Gregorie Pope of Rome who ſent ſainct Auguſtin the Monke into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to plant the then profeſſed Roman faith ther were no other Preiſts or Bishops but ſuch as had their authority deriued from the Roman ſeat, &amp; ſuch Bishops onelie as were ordained &amp; conſecrated with the ſame matter &amp; forme of Order &amp; with Vnction, Miter, Croſier &amp; other ſuch ornaments &amp; ceremonies as the Church of Rome actuallie vſeth at this day.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17282:49"/>Nay nor yet in the time of Wiclif or ſince is there anie mention in anie hiſtorie, writer or recorde either Catholike or Proteſtant of anie kinde of eyther Bishops, Preiſts, or ordination of the ſame, vſed in England before the Reigne of Edwarde the ſixt. Wherefore altho' we should graunt the Patrons of the English faith that their Religion was profeſſed in England in more ancient times as they pretend (the contrarie of which neuertheleſſe is as certaine as it is certaine there is no mention of it in anie more ancienthiſtorie or recorde then the dayes of Edward the ſixt) yet is it manifeſt that it hath had a notable interruption in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Bishops &amp; Preiſts to wit for the ſpace of 800. yeares at the leaſt euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the confeſſion of our aduerſaries: And conſequentlie it is euident that it hath not a continuall &amp; diſinterrupted ſucceſſion of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops &amp; Preiſts deriued from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Secondlie I proue there is no coutinuall &amp; diſinterrupted ſucceſſion of Bishops &amp; Preiſts in the English Religion deriued from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Becauſe altho' we should admit that in the time of King Edward by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſucceſſion of his newe Religion to the Religion of his Father Henry the 8. at whoſe death we doe not denie but there were true Bishops &amp; Preiſts lefte who might perhaps for as much as concerneth the eſſence of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17282:49"/>(thou' not lawfullie) either haue conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated others, or they themſelues haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church according to the newe forme of the ſame, (which fact I need not here diſpute but omit as vngranted) Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe it is certaine &amp; graunted by both parties that euen in this there was another plaine interruption, &amp; that within a verie shorte time vpon the ſucceſſion of Queene Marie to the Crowne in here brothers place, who exauthorizing all that newe brood of Bishops &amp; Preiſts, reeſtablished the Roman Religion in the ſame forme &amp; with ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates &amp; Preiſts as had ben in the Realme in all former times, as not onelie all written hiſtories &amp; recordes, but alſo ſome eye witneſſes who then did ſee the change, &amp; being yet aliue can at this daye teſtifie the ſame. So that euen in this particular manner the newe Religion of England hath ſuffered an interruption in the ſucceſſion of Bishops &amp; Preiſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie. I proue the ſame <hi>minor</hi> propoſition becauſe at the time of the laſt change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at the death of Queene Marie, all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishops were depoſed &amp; depriued of their dignities excepting onelie the Archbishop of Canterburie whoſe ſeat was vacant by his death; &amp; others were put in their places by the authoritie of Queene Elizabeth &amp; here parlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who neuertheleſſe were ſuch as did not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17282:50"/>agree either in vocation, miſſion, or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their predeceſſors: as appeareth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Maſter Parker who not obſtanding he was the cheefe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as being Archbishop of Caterburie &amp; primate, yet is he confeſſed by Maſter Maſon a miniſter &amp; profeſſed defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the newe clargie of England, to haue ben the firſt of 70. Archbishops ſince fainct Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin that receiued Orders &amp; conſecration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Popes Bulles, &amp; the reſt of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vſed in the ordination of all thoſe 70. that preceded him. And the ſame he might haue ſaid of the newe Bishops of theſe dayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with all that longe ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>The which difference in the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration altho' it were alone ſufficient accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the Roman Church to exclude the ordained from true ſucceſſion as being at the leaſt ſchiſmaticall in itſelfe &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the practice of ancient times euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dayes of ſainct Auguſtin the Apoſtle of our countrie, as both the writings of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers (which I will produce in an other place) &amp; alſo ſome ancient authenticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories or recordes of the Realme doe teſtifie: Yet euen according to the Principles of the English Religion there is an eſſentiall defect founde in the ſame, in regarde that Maſter Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17282:50"/>conſecrator of Parker, had neuer anie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration himſelfe. Or if he had anie, he was made Bishop, (if not Preiſt alſo) onelie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme diuiſed in the time of Edward the Sixt, &amp; confirmed by Queene Elizabeth the eight yeare of her Reigne. That which I ſuppoſe Maſter Maſon himſelfe doth not deny. Which forme as it is ſet in their Rituall or manner of making Bishops, Preiſts, &amp; Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, printed at London 1607. as being neither founde in ſcripture, nor conformable to anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme of conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer vſed in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church ſince the Chriſtian Religion was founded, the perſons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated or ordained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of it, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not poſſible betrue Bishops preiſts or Deacons, &amp; by neceſſarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence neither Maſter Parker nor anie other of his fellowe Bishops could receiue true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or conſecration as being ordained both by one that had no power of Order himſelf, nor yet did couſecrate them with the ſame eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall matter &amp; forme which hath ben com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie vſed in the Chriſtian world in ancient ages: But onelie according to that new forme which as Maſter Maſon confeſſeth being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed &amp; authorized onelie by King Edwarde &amp; Queene Elizabeth who had no power to alter the forme of Ordination practiced generallie in the Chriſtian Church before their times, could not poſſible giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Apoſtolicall power
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17282:51"/>of ordination, &amp; conſequentlie they had no continuall diſinterrupted ſucceſſion in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deriued from the Apoſtles, which is that by the <hi>minor</hi> of my argument I intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince.</p>
               <p>Peraduenture our aduerſaries will replie &amp; ſay. Firſt that the whole eſſentiall matter &amp; forme of Order conſiſting of impoſition of handes &amp; the wordes, <hi>receiue the holie Ghoſt</hi> were applyed to Maſter Parker &amp; the reſt of the miniſtrie in their ordination, &amp; the Roman rites or Ceremonies onelie omitted, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make nor marre the ſubſtance of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>But to this I reioine firſt that this doth not cleare Maſter Barlowes conſecration of which there being no authenticall regiſter or recorde extant, he cannot be eſteemed to haue ben a true Bishop, &amp; conſequenthe he had no power to conſecrate others, &amp; ſo Maſter Parker ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he had the true matter &amp; forme of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Order applied vnto him, yet could he not be true Bishop for want of authoritie in his ordainer, who could not poſſible giue that he had not himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondlie. It is falſe that thoſe wordes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the holie Ghoſt, with impoſition of handes onelie, are the whole matter &amp; forme of conſecration of Bishops, for that neither ſcripture, Councels, nor Fathers, nor the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17282:51"/>practice of the Church, doe teach the ſame: but rather on the contrarie, it is manifeſt that another forme of Ordination was vſed in the primatiue Church as doth appeare) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit other authorities) by the wordes of ſainct Ambroſe vpon the 13. chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles. Where expounding thoſe words, <hi>Ieiunantes, imponentesque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is manies:</hi> He ſaith that impoſition of handes is myſticall wordes, where with the perſon elected is confirmed to this worke receiuing authoritie (his conſcience bearing him witneſſe) that he may be bould in our Lordes name to offer ſacrifice to God. By which wordes, the reader may plainelie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that in ſainct Ambroſes time there was more required in the matter &amp; forme of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Bishops then impoſition of handes onelie with thoſe wordes receiue the holie Ghoſt, to wit ſome other wordes by which the perſon ordained receiueth power to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which wordes neuertheleſſe were neuer vſed in the conſecration either of Maſter Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or anie other of the Bishops or miniſters of the English Church as by them themſelues is confeſſed who by neceſſarie ſequele muſt alſo needs confeſſe the ſame Bishops &amp; miniſters to be eſſentiallie defectiue &amp; voy de of true ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie according to the ſtorie of the Nag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges head tauerne as it was related by Maſter
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17282:52"/>Neale ſome time profeſſor of languages in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, who was a man that both by reaſon of his ancient yeares, as alſo for the meanes he had to know the trueth as being imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this ſame buſines by Bishop Boner then depoſed &amp; priſoner, ought in all reaſon to be credited: Maſter Parker was not ordained at all by Maſter Barlowe but by Maſter Scorie who by reaſon he had she name of Bishop du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reigne of King Enwarde, (&amp; becauſe Maſter Kitching being a true Bishop tho' then depoſed with the reſt of the Catholike Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Queenes Maries time, partelie out of ſcruple of conſcience, &amp; partelie for feare of Excommunication menaced towardes him by Bishop Bonner, refuſed to conſecrate the newe ſuperintendents,) vndertooke the worke in the foreſaid Tauerne where a meeting was made to that purpoſe, &amp; Scorie cauſing them all to kneele, he tooke the Bible &amp; laid it vpon them bidding them take authoritie to preach the worde of God ſincerelie, who without anie more wordes or deedes all eſcaped Bishops of the new fashion: And Maſter Parker hauing either better fortune or better fauor then the reſt, for his parce he got the Archbishoprie of Canterburie and the primacie of England. The others being ſeaſed according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall lots and election of the Queene.</p>
               <p>Whence it clearelie appeareth that by which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17282:52"/>ſoeuer of theſe formes Maſter Parker &amp; his fellowes were conſecrated, yet they haue no true Canonicall ordination neither according to the ſcriptures nor according to the ancient practice of the Church, &amp; by vnauoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they haue no true ſucceſſion deriued from the Apoſtles, but as an ancient Father ſaith of other heretikes of his time, ſo we may ſay of them, that ſucceeding to none they are prodigiouſlie borne of themſelues.
<note place="margin">Cypr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Prael.</note> And ſainct Cyprian of others ſaith in like manner that without anie lawe of ordination they preferre themſelues, &amp; aſſume the name of Bishops not hauing the Epiſcopate coferred vpon them by anie. Both which ſentences may verie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie be applyed to our nominall Bishops of England who as I haue declared receiue their Bishopries without law full authoritie.</p>
               <p>Yet notobſtanding all this which hath ben ſaid, perhaps ſome of them will inſiſte further in their owne defence &amp; ſay that althou' they haue no perſonall ſucceſſion, yet they haue doctrinall ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they maintaine the ſame doctrine which the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſors in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church preached &amp; tought.</p>
               <p>To which I anſer that this is the common euaſion of thoſe onelie who defend the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the Church, but it doth nothing auaile thoſe who pretende to defend the continuall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17282:53"/>viſibilitie of the ſame as they doe againſt whome I now diſpute. Secondlie whoſoeuer maintaines this, It is but a miere shif or cloake wherewith to couer the nakednes of their new borne Religion, which if it had not falſelie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed itſelfe with the Apoſtolicall robes it could not for shame haue appeared in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike by reaſon of the great deformitie it hath in doctrine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. If the English Religion hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of doctrine &amp; not of perſons, wher was it from the fift or ſixt hundreth yeare till the dayes of Luther. Was it in men or in beaſts? In beaſtes they will not ſay for the auoyding of their owne shame. And if it was in men, then showe vs wher, &amp; when thoſe men liued, otherwiſe we will giue no more credit vnto our aduerſaries wordes then we doe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they crye out &amp; ſay it is Apoſtolicall doctrine but proues it not, as ordinarily they do both in their bookes &amp; preachings.</p>
               <p>Peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they will ſay their Religion was neither in men nor beaſts but in bookes they meane in the bookes of the old &amp; newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this is yet more falſe &amp; abſurde then the reſt, for that doctrine inuolued in bookes can not make ſucceſſion, ſucceſſion being and order or ſeries of things imediately following one &amp; other, which order doctrine meluded in papers or partchement can not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17282:53"/>haue as being one &amp; the ſame obiect of faith, &amp; quite indiſtinguible in it ſelfe, &amp; can be onely intentionally or obiectiuely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished or deuided by the perſons in which as an accident it is ſubiected &amp; receiued. Beſides. All the tyme that thoſe fantaſtikes imagin their doctrine to haue ben continually ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue in the Bible, if they them ſelues or at leaſt other their companions in ſect were not, as ther confeſſe, howe can they knowe at this preſent that anie ſuch bookes or doctrine was then in the world when themſelues were not. If they ſay they haue that knowledge from the Romaniſts, then ſay I why doe they not alſo giue credit vnto the ſame Romaniſts in other matters of faith, as particularly in that point of the number of Canonicall ſcriptures, &amp; of the true ſenſe of them as they ar applyed to euerie Controuerſie betwixt vs &amp; them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that long ſpace in which ther were none of their Religion extant, among all which points of difference ther is none more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant then that of the infallible knowledge of thoſe diuine bookes (which the Romaniſts had in their cuſtodie all the tyme of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries non exiſtence) to be the onely true authenticall worde of God. So that for theſe men to affirme they haue all wayes had a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles without a perſonall is a miere Puritanicall dreame, &amp; a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17282:54"/>Chymericall conceite &amp; paradox of their owne forgeing, an Idea of Plato abſtracted one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by diſtracted myndes.</p>
               <p>Finally for proofe that the English Religion hath no true Preiſts &amp; Bishops I adde, that our Sauior ordained his Apoſtles not onely to preach his worde but alſo to remit ſinnes &amp; offer ſacrifice according to thoſe two texts of ſcripture:

               <head>THE SIXT PRINCIPAL ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>MY ſixt principall argument is this.</p>
               <p>That Religion is falſe which hath no true adoration or worship of God proper to him onely.</p>
               <p>But the English Religion hath no adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor worship of God proper to him onely.</p>

                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is a falſe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The Maior muſt of neceſſitie be graunted by the profeſſors of the English Reigno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they deſtroye &amp; amhilate the verie life of all Religion which is the worship or adoration of one onely God with ſuch honor as is proper &amp; due vnto him as both diuine faith &amp; leight of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17282:57"/>nature doe teach: yea &amp; doutleſſe the trueth of this propoſition is contained in the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement which doth not onely exclude the pluralitie of Gods &amp; their adoration, but alſo includeth that worship which is due &amp; proper to one onely God &amp; not to anie creature or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other entitie whatſoeuer. And for this cauſe God himſelf in other places co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundes: <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Deum tuum adorabis &amp; illi ſoli ſeruies.</hi> Thou shalt adore thy Lord thy God &amp; ſerue him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

And now this precept being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the lawe of nature, the naturall inſtinct of reaſon doth likewiſe ſuggeſt the ſame, ſo that no rationall creature can denie it.</p>
               <p>Nowe the <hi>Minor</hi> of my ſilogiſme in which all or the greateſt parte of the difficultie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts I proue it by an other ſilogiſme in this manner.</p>
               <p>That Religion hath no true adoration or worship of God which hath no exerciſe of a true &amp; proper ſacrifice or oblation.</p>
               <p>But the Religion of England hath no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a true &amp; proper ſacrifice or oblation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Religion of England hath no true adoration or worship of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> of the latter ſilogiſme in caſe it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17282:58"/>should be denied by our aduerſaries, &amp; proue firſt by ſcripture &amp; then by teſtimonies of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers to wit that true Religion cannot ſtand without true &amp; proper worship of God by frequent vſe or exerciſe of a true &amp; proper ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And altho' this might be ſufficiently proued by a generall induction drawne not onely from the practice of the vniuerſall world in all ages as well in the profeſſors of the true God of which the old Teſtament giueth euidence as alſo from the falſe religion of all ſortes of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, Gentils &amp; Paganes. Yet becauſe I knowe the Noueliſts out of their preſumption &amp; impudencie will not ſtick to denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I will omit to perſecute this manner of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; onely inſiſt in thoſe authorities of Scripture &amp; doctors of the Church which immediatly conuince the ſame to be true alſo in our Chriſtian Religion of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>My firſt proofe of ſcripture I take out of ſome certaine places of the Prophets, which notobſtanding they ſeeme to belong to the old teſtament yet in realitie they appertaine to the newe as being predictions of the ſtate of Religion in the ſame. To which purpoſe the Propheſie of Malachie is moſt plaine for the future practice of a proper &amp; generall ſacrifice in the new Teſtament, affirming. That the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17282:58"/>Lord of Hoſtes ſaith this. <hi>I haue no will in you</hi> (meaning the Preiſts of the old Teſtament) <hi>nor will I receiue an offering at your handes for from theriſing of the ſunne to the ſetting my name is great among the Gentils, &amp; in euerieplace is ther Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced &amp; offered vnto my name a cleane oblation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my name is great among nations.</hi> Thus farre the Prophet. Now the wordes &amp; circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this place ſo plainely demonſtrate that the Prophet Malachie ſpeakes of ſome kinde of ſacrifice which was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or euer before vſed in anie time or place but was to be vſed in the new teſtament, that our aduerſaries leaſt they should be conuinced of error in their Religion for that it hath no externall oblation to God at all, they finde no other refuge then to feigne that the Prophet ſpeaketh onely of the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall ſacrifice of prayer &amp; good workes. Which interpretation of theirs altho' it were neuer ſo true (as it is moſt clearely falſe) yet is it little ſutable to other poſitions &amp; practice at leaſt of Caluiniſts,
<note place="margin">Vid. Dan. Cham.</note> as that good works are ſinnes in themſelues yea &amp; damnable if God did not mercifully perdon them: &amp; that they are not pleaſing to God. Nay prayer &amp; good workes are ſo litle &amp; couldly practiced among them all that if ther were no other ſacrifice in the world, doubtleſſe God almightie should, by them eſpecially, be verie couldly ſerued.</p>
               <p>How be it that cleare it is out of the related
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17282:59"/>text that Malachie treates not of anie vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſacrifice. Firſt becauſe it is euident that he propheſied of ſuch a future ſacrifice as should be more proper &amp; pleaſing to God then theſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices offered in the time of the old lawe which neuertheleſſe being properly and truely ſacrifices altho' in other reſpects defectiue, that which should ſucceed vnto them could not in compariſon of them be eſteemed more proper &amp; pleaſing ſacrifice to God then they were, if truely and properly it had not ben a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Secondly. The Hebrewe text with the cleane oblation ioyneth <hi>incenſe</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of both thoſe rites togither doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly shewe the Propheſie to be of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rite &amp; oblation to God, &amp; conſequently a proper ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. It is plaine by the wordes of the text that the Prophet ſpeaketh of ſuch an externall ritie as mayntaines the greatnes of Gods name euen among Gentiles &amp; infidels, which prayer &amp; good workes onely cannot effecte by reaſon they ar neither ſo apparent &amp; knowne among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor ſo publike a teſtimonie of the maieſtie of God as ſacrifice is without which his diuine renowne, magnificence &amp; ſoueraintie would be extinguished in people in proceſſe of time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly true &amp; proper ſacrifice is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parte of a true &amp; proper Religion &amp; a maine diſtinctiue ſigne from vn proper &amp; falſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17282:59"/>Religions, &amp; of ſuch a one the Prophet treates as is both different from the ſacrifice of the Gentiles yea &amp; of the Iewes them ſelues: now prayer &amp; workes ar common to euerie Religion euerie one according to their ſeuerall manner.</p>
               <p>And to this declaration of the text I adde the expeſitions of all thoſe ancient Fathers who haue applyed this place of malachie to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt as to the onely &amp; proper ſacrifice of the newe Teſtament ther being not one extant in all antiquitie who hath deliuered anie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſenſe of it, or that hath explicated it of prayers or workes alone. S. Iuſtin martyr who liued within the compaſſe of the ſecond age, ſpeaketh plainely to this purpoſe citing the wordes of the prophet,
<note place="margin">Dialogo c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Tryphone.</note> in which he affirmes that malachie foretels a newe oblation to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſacrifice of the Iewes, ſaying. <hi>De hoſtijs quae ipſi (deo) à nobis Gentibus vbique offeruntur id eſt Eucharistiae, tum predicit cum ait, à nobis nomen ſuum gloria affici vobis autem pollui.</hi> Which is this in English. God by Malachye the Prophet (for in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner Iuſtin ſpeaketh in his precedent wordes) doth propheſie of the hoaſtes or ſacrifices which are in euerie place offered by vs Gentils (meaning conuerted Gentils) that is of the bread of the Euchariſt, &amp; likewiſe of the cup of the Enchariſt, when he ſaith that his name is glorified by vs but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17282:60"/>polluted by you, meaning the Preiſts of the old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Now ſince this renowned martyr both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly declares that the Prophet Malachies prediction is meante of the Euchariſt, &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he further affirmes the ſame Euchariſt to haue ben offered by the Chriſtian Preiſts of his tyme in all places, yea &amp; that therby the name of God is glorified: it is extreame want of iudgement or rather plaine madnes in our aduerſaries, to denie that the Prophet ſpeaketh of a true &amp; proper ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And althou the ſame Father in his precedent lines doth inſinuate that the Euchariſt is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarumaction or rendering of thankes for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers benefits receiued by Chriſtians at the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of God as the creation of the worlde &amp; the memorie of their Redemption &amp; other of that nature: yet thoſe or the like cauſes of the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Euchariſt doe no more diminish the nature of a true ſacrifice included in the ſame, then <hi>hostia pacifica</hi> the hoaſte of pacification did ceaſe to be a true oblation or ſacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was offered by way of thankes giuing for benefits receiued, or els to obtaine new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors &amp; graces of God almightie. By which alſo the friuolous euaſion of kemntitius &amp; other Nouelliſts appeares to be voyde of force while they endeuoure to illude the ſtreingth of this moſt pregnant teſtimonie for the proofe of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17282:60"/>Euchariticall ſacrifice of the lawe of Chriſt, for that reaſon to wit becauſe the author of the ſame teſtimonie in the ſame place affirmes our ſauior to haue comaunded the Euchariſt to be celebrated in remembrance of his death an paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if the one &amp; the other could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ſame action either according to diuine ſcripture or naturall reaſon, neither of which is founde repugnant but rather moſt conformable &amp; agreeing.

               </p>
               <p>S. Irenaeus in like manner being one of the ſame ſtanding teſtifies that the Prophet Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie did preſignifie the Euchariſt in thoſe ſame wordes which he cites &amp; ſaith. That bread which is made of a creature he (that is Chriſt) tooke &amp; gaue thankes ſaying this is my bodie. And likewiſe the chalis which is of a creature which is according to vs, confeſſed it to be his owne bloud, &amp; taught vs a newe oblation of the newe Teſtament, which the Church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from the Apoſtles offers to God in the vniuerſall world to him who giues vs for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment the primicies of firſt frutes of his gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, of which Malachie one of the twelue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did ſo preſignifie. <hi>Lhaue no pleaſure in you.</hi> And that ſainct Irenaeus ſpeaketh not of an vnproper Sacrifice as Kemnitius &amp; ſome other ſectaries doe cauille, is moſt euident by other wordes of his towardes the end of the ſame chapter, where he addeth that the former
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17282:61"/>people that is the Iewes shall ceaſe to offer to God: Yet neuertheleſſe that in euerie place a pure Sacrifice is offerred vnto him, &amp; his name glorified among the Gentils.</p>
               <p>More ouer in his 24. chapter he ſaith that one kinde of ſacrifice is reproued by God mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſacrifice of the Iewes, to which the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the of Church ſucceedes. By which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe &amp; particularlie by thoſe wordes which he ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>noui Testamenti nouam docuit oblatiouem,</hi> that is <hi>he taught a newe oblation of the newe Teſtament,</hi> it is clearelie conuinced that this holie Father by the worde oblation could not poſſible vnderſtand almes as our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries contendes becauſe altho' it be in ſome ſorte an oblation to God, yet is it neither newe nor proper to the newe Teſtament onelie, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both old &amp; newe as the ſcripture it ſelf doth moſt frequently teach &amp; inculcate. More ouer this place of ſainct Irenaeus did ſo farre conuince the iudgement of Caluin in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that like the deuils which according to the relation of the Euangeliſt, acknowledged Chriſt againſt their wils, he confeſſeth him to haue expounded it of the Maſſe iuſte as the Romaniſts of later times vſe to interpret &amp; applie it, &amp; hath no other refuge then plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie to contradict the foreſaid ancient Fathers expoſition in this impudent &amp; audatious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſayeing of the Roman diuines. When they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17282:61"/>obiect the place of Malachie to be vnderſtood ſo (of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe) by Irenaeus, &amp; the offering of Melchiſedech in like manner by Athanaſius, Ambroſe, Auguſtin, &amp; Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius: it is breefelie anſered, that the ſame wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe in other places alſo interpret bread the bodie of Chriſt, but ſo ridiculouſlie that reaſon &amp; trueth conſtreineth vs to diſſent from them: thus this ſaucie Nouelliſt, ſpeakes of his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe pride &amp; bouldnes the Centuriſts imitate treating this ſame point in their third Centurie, as if they were the onelie men in the world borne for reaſon, &amp; not thoſe rather who immediatelie ſucceeding the Apoſtles did infinitlie ſurpaſſe them both in virtue &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtian doctrine &amp; true ſenſe of Gods diuine worde &amp; inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Tertullian declaring the ſacrifice prophecied by Malachie againſt Marcion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacrificium purum glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, ſcilicet, relatio &amp; benedictio, &amp; laus, &amp; hymni &amp;c.</hi> Lib. 3.

By <hi>relation</hi> he vnderſtandes the Epiſtle &amp; Goſpell, by <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> the conſecration, by <hi>praiſe &amp; himnes</hi> the glorie, prayers &amp; other ſpirituall paſſages contained in that miſterie. And altho' this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in an other place of this ſame booke doth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17282:62"/>affirme the place of Malachie to be vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſacrifice of praier, &amp; in his booke againſt the Iewes, of ſpirituall not of terrene ſacrifices: Yet in neither place doth he deny it to be truely interpreted of the Euchariſt: But in the firſt place he calleth it a ſpirituall ſacrifice becauſe it was inſtituted by the diuine ſpirit &amp; not by humane inuention: as alſo for that it is not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in that carnall &amp; groſſe manner in which the Iewish ſacrifices were miniſtred by effuſion of bloud, by fire &amp; knife, but by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction &amp; conſecration as ſuch a pure oblation ought to be handled &amp; celebrated. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place Tertullian onelie interpreteth one parte of the ſentence of Malachie to wit the word <hi>incenſe</hi> which is in the Hebrewe text, of prayer offered to God. But the other wordes, <hi>oblatio munda,</hi> he expoundes of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, in the place nowe cited. To which if we adde an other place of the ſame author in which he ſpeaketh of the Euchariſticall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<note place="margin">De Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione cap. 14.</note> all tergiuerſation muſt neceſſarily ceaſe in anie indifferent minde touching this authors true meaning.

Hauing receiued &amp; reſerued the bodie of our Lord, both the one &amp; the other is ſafe, the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacrifice, &amp; the execution of the office.</hi> By which wordes it is manifeſt that ancient Tertullian could neuer denie the Sacrament
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17282:62"/>of the Altar to be a proper oblation who here ſo abſolutelie affirmes it to be a ſacrifice cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Altar.</p>
               <p>S. Cyprian liuing within the third hundreth yeare in like manner cites the ſame place of Malachie in the 16. chapter of his booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iewes to proue that which he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the title of the ſame chapter, to wit that the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſacrifice is euacuated &amp; a new on ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, which newe ſacrifice can be no other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Euchariſt, which onely &amp; no other is new in reſpect of the ſacrifices of the old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>The next in Order &amp; age is Euſebius who liuing in the beginning of the 400.
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. demonſt. Euang. cap. vlt.</note> yeare interprets this place of Malachie in the ſame ſenſe, ſayeing. We therefore ſacrifice vnto the moſt high God a ſacrifice of laude: We ſacrifice a ſacrifice <hi>Deo plenum,</hi> full of God: And bringing an odoriferous ſent with it, &amp; a ſacred or Sacroſainct ſacrifice, we ſacrifice after a newe manner a pure or cleane ſacrifice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the newe Teſtament. Where it is plaine that Euſebius applies the place of Malachie to the ſolemne ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which is performed by prayer &amp; oblation &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by his a ſacrifice of laude, &amp; which onelie can be truelie ſaid to be full of God by reaſon of Chriſt whome it containeth, &amp; which onelie can be called truely the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the new Teſtament, &amp; affirmed to be

And hence I paſſe to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of teſtimonies of the new Teſtament for proofe of a proper ſacrifice in the lawe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in the fourth chapter of the Euangell of ſainct Iohn, affirmeth that the houre is now come when true adorers shall adore the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father in ſpirit &amp; truth: &amp; neither in the mountaine of Samaria nor in Ieruſalem as he ſaid immediatly before:
<note place="margin">Garizim</note> in which place the worde adore ſignifies to ſacrifice as in diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of ſcripture it doth &amp; particularlie the 22. of Geneſis where Abraham preparing to ſacrifice is ſonne ſaith to his ſeruants. Expect here with the aſſe I &amp; the boy makeing haſte thither after we haue adored will returne vnto you. Where it is cleare that the worde adore cannot ſignifie anie other adoration then that which Abraham was aboute, that is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his ſonne. The likeplace you haue Iohn the 12. of certaine Gentils who aſcended in to the temple to adore in the feaſt day. And the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17282:64"/>Eunuch come to adore in Ieruſalem the 8. of the Acts.
<note place="margin">In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Malach. 1.</note> In fine according to the iudgement of Theodoret &amp; Rupert, this place of ſainct Iohn alludes to that other of Malachie aboue cited &amp; diſcuſſed &amp; hath the like ſenſe. Which perhaps theſe two authors receiued from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius who affirmes the ſame in his firſt booke of his Euang. demonſt. &amp; ſixt chapter. &amp; thence it is conſequent that this place is vnderſtanded of the Euchariſt as the place of the Prophet is, that is in a proper ſignification of ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And other principall proofe of a proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the newe Teſtament is deduced from the inſtitution of the Euchariſt the 28. of ſainct Mathew the 14. of ſainct Marke the 22. of S. Luke &amp; the 11. chapter of the firſt to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, in this manner &amp; forme of Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</p>
               <p>A proper ſacrifice is an externall oblation of ſome ſenſible &amp; permanent creature conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; changed by myſticall ryte or Ceremonie by a lawfull Preiſt, for the a knowledgement of the diuine maieſtie &amp; ſupreme power &amp; domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt in his laſt ſupper made ſuch an oblation when he inſtituted the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> Chriſt in his laft ſupper offered a proper ſacrifice when he inſtituted the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>maior</hi> there is no controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17282:65"/>vs &amp; our aduerſaries as I ſuppoſe, or at the leaſt I perſuade my ſelfe they will not much ſtand vpon it. The <hi>minor</hi> I proue by an other Sylogiſme.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in his laſte ſupper being a lawfull Preiſt according to the Order of Melchiſadech offered his owne bodie &amp; bloude to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father vnder the ſenſible formes of bread &amp; wine commaunding his Apoſtles to doe the ſame.</p>
               <p>But this is a true &amp; proper ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt offered &amp; commaunded his Apoſtles to offer a true &amp; proper ſacrifice in his laſt ſupper.</p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> of this latter Sylogiſme I proue becauſe except Chriſt had not offered in this manner in his laſt ſupper he had neuer perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the function of a true Preiſt according to the Order of Melchiſadec. Neither had he properlie verified &amp; fulfilled the figure of the Paſquall lambe. Nor could he haue truelie affirmed his bloud in his laſt ſupper to be the bloud of the new teſtament if he had not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered then both bodie &amp; bloud in ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the Euangliſt S. Luke relating the inſtitution of the Euchariſt vnder the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of wine affirmes our ſauior to haue vſed theſe wordes. <hi>This chalis is the new Teſtament in my bloud which is shed for you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iuc. 22.</note> In which wordes both the worde <hi>shed</hi> which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17282:65"/>tenſe, as alſo the relatiue <hi>which:</hi> which (according to the Greek text which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries moſt eſteme &amp; followe) muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie haue relation to the preſent sheding of the cup, or chalis: &amp; like wiſe thoſe wordes <hi>for you,</hi> manifeſtly conclude that our ſauiour did then in that ſolemne action of his laſt ſupper, ſacrifice his bloud: &amp; the ſame is of his bodie of which the ſame S. Luke ſaith in the preſent tenſe <hi>which is giuen for you:</hi> yea I ſay all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances plainely demonſtrate to all vnob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate mindes that Chriſt did truely &amp; proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice his bodie &amp; bloud when he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; deliuered the Euchariſt to his Apoſtles with an expreſſe commaundement to doe the ſame. And hence it neceſſarily followes that tho Euchariſt is a true &amp; proper ſacrifice of the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as often as it is celebrated by Preiſts according to the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; precept of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>An other argument to proue that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is a proper ſacrifice I frame thus.</p>
               <p>That is a proper ſacrifice in which a victime or hoaſte is receiued as a thing offered of giuen for the receiuers in honor of God.</p>
               <p>But in the Euchariſt the victime or hoaſt of Chriſts bodie &amp; bloud is receiued as a thing offered or giuen for the receiuers in honor of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Euchariſt is a proper ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>In the maior there is no doubt as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17282:66"/>The <hi>Minor</hi> in which the controuerſie ſtandes. I proue firſt becauſe S. Luke affirmes Chriſt to haue ſaid. <hi>This is my bodie which is giuen for you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap 22.</note> And the like he ſaith of the chalis in the manner aboue declared according to the phraſe of the Greeke text. And according to this ſenſe of the Euangeliſt S. Auguſtin in the 9. booke &amp; 13. chapters of his confeſſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that his mother day lie ſerued the Altar in which she did knowe the holie victime or hoaſte to be diſpenſed or miniſtred. Now that ther is oblation in the Euchariſt, the verie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the matter doth plainely argue, for that where a victime or hoaſte is, ther of neceſſitie muſt be immolation as being correlatiues the one in reſpect of the other, yea and immolation neceſſarily includes oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſanie reaſon of correlation: &amp; moreouer both theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in conſecration which by the power of Gods worde maketh preſent the bodie and bloud of Chriſt in ſuch a manner as they may be decently &amp; conueniently conſummated by participation of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And in this ſorte the Euchariſt included all thoſe conditions which a proper ſacrifice euen according to our aduerſaries at leaſt the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, ought to haue. Firſt the ſubſtance of the hoaſte or victim. Secondly a certaine ryte or action of offering preſcribed by God, which is the celebration of the Euchariſt inſtituted by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17282:66"/>Chriſt in the forme deſcribed by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts &amp; the Apoſtle S. Paule.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> Thirdly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offering deputed by God to that function which is the Preiſt. Fourthly. The ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of offering or the ſame end which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God in his worde that is to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God &amp; for the repreſentation of the paſſion of Chriſt. Neyther is it neceſſarie that all theſe particulars be contained in the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in expreſſe wordes, but it is ſufficient that they be included in it in ſome intelligible manner. Otherwiſes it followes that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt had ben no true &amp; proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice becauſe he vſed not the wordes <hi>offer</hi> or <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> when he ſuffered vpon the Croſſe, which ſequele I am perſuaded our aduerſaries will not graunte.</p>
               <p>Diuers other places of ſcripture ar alledged by Bellarmin &amp; other diuines for the proofe of this point, but for the auoy dance of prolixitie, I will conclude with that onely of the 13. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Acts. Where for the ordination of S. Paule &amp; S. Bernabe it is related that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were miniſting to our lord &amp; faſting. Now to miniſter to our lord can not conſiſt either in prayer onely, or in ſinging uf pſalmes, which needed no Kynde of miniſtration more then opening their mouthes &amp; hartes: wher as yet the worde miniſtere doth neceſſarily include ſome externall ryte more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that as the Greke

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17282:71"/>or obiect of faith, it hath vniuerſallitie of time, place &amp; perſons that profeſſe it: &amp; alſo it hath vniuerſallitie of the rule or reaſon which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the profeſſors in the confeſſion &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their faith, &amp; with all it hath vnitie in the ſame.</p>
               <p>And firſt that the Roman Religion hath vniuerſallitie in matter it is moſt manifeſt for that the aduerſaries them ſelues can not denye but that it conprehendeth by faith &amp; beleeueth not onely all that is contained in the ſcriptures, but alſo what ſoeuer els is propoſed by their Church as matter of faith, comprehended either in the written worde of God, or diuine traditions which are the vnwritten worde of God: which is the moſt large &amp; compleit vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſallitie of faith that can be imagined, to the latitude of which the obiect or matter of the English faith comes not neare as being by them limited to the bare ſcriptures onely. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe they denie points which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church maintaines for matters of faith. As ar Purgatorie, prayer to ſaincts &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly. That the Roman Religion hath vniuerſallitie in the rule or reaſon which gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the profeſſors of it in their true beleefe it is alſo euident in regarde they neither beleeue, nor refuſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o beleeue anie thing as matter of faith for anie other immediate motiue or cauſe then for that it is propoſed vnto them by the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17282:72"/>infallible authoritie of their Church to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued or not to be beleeued as the worde of God which is the prime &amp; formall obiect of their faith, which generallitie or vniuerſalitie of rule is ſo great &amp; ſolid that it is inpoſſible to imagin anie more ample &amp; perfect in that nature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. This moſt conſtant &amp; vnuariable vniuerſallitie of the totall rule of faith as it is but one onely in it ſelfe, ſo doth one onely agreeable &amp; vniforme conſent of faith neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily flowe &amp; iſſue out of it as frome a moſt cleare fountaine, which is vnitie in the ſame faith among all &amp; euerie one of the profeſſors of it: ſuppoſing that according to true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, where the formall obiect is one, the actions tho' neuerſo manie, muſt of neceſſitie be of one &amp; the ſame ſpecies or nature, that which in ſupernaturall faith is yet more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; apparent by reaſon the obiect of it is exceedingly more vniforme &amp; vnuariable then anie naturall obiect is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Vniuerſallitie of tyme, place &amp; perſons is ſo manifeſtly founde in the Roman Religion: that the aduerſaries them ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that ther hath ben euer a viſible Roman Religion in the world from the tyme of the Apoſtles euen to this preſent day: which yet if they were ſo impudent as to denie, all hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all writings, all acts &amp; monuncents, euen
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17282:72"/>the verie ſtones them ſelues in manie places would quite conuince &amp; confounde them. Onely one exception or euaſion they haue to wit by alledgeing that altho' the Roman Church for the ſpace of the fiue hundreth firſt yeares was a true Church yea &amp; the mother Church of all the reſt of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtian Churches,
<note place="margin">Praeſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> as great King Iames doth ingenuouſly confeſſe, yet ſay they hath it ſince fayled in faith, &amp; of the Church of Chriſt is turned in to the ſeat of Antichriſt: viz: when Phocas the Emperour gaue vnto Boniface the third Pope of that name the title of vniuerſall Bishop.</p>
               <p>This therefore is our aduerſaries common allegation for proofe of the ſuppoſed defection of the Roman Church in matters of faith, but ſo feeble friuolous &amp; falſe that both they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, if they were not verie bleareyed, &amp; all others might as it were in a miroir, or perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue glaſſe clearely diſcouer this by the viewe of the ſucceſſe of times to be but falſe colors &amp; painting whereby to limme their owne inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable defection from that faith which they founde vniuerſallie eſtablished in the Chriſtian world when their firſt founders began to broach their owne pretended reformation.</p>
               <p>For firſt I ſay that if for either Phocas to giue or Bonifacius to take the title of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Bishop were to reuolt or make a defection
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17282:73"/>from the true faith or Church: then should the whole Generall Councell of Calcedon haue reuolted from the true faith by offering to attribute it to Pope Leo,
<note place="margin">Lib. 47. Epiſt. 32.</note> as ſainct Gregorie doth teſtifie: &amp; if this had ben ſo hainous a buſines as our aduerſaries contend, it is teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to affirme or imagine that ſo famous a Councell conſiſting of ſo manie graue &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishops both Grecians &amp; Latin &amp; which our aduerſaries themſelues admit for legitimate would euer haue as much as mentioned ſuch a matter.</p>
               <p>Secondlie. This being a matter of fact which can not be decided by either ſcriptures or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers or the Primatiue ages in regarde it is knowne to haue happened after them both: our onelie iudges muſt be thoſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians who haue made relation of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Now thoſe relators which are Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Bibliothecarius, Pulus Diaconus, Ado, &amp; venerable Beda, none of them affirme either that Phocas did giue Boniface anie authoritie of Primacie which he had not afore, nor yet doe they or laye anie cenſure vpon the one or the other for that action whatſouer it was.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie. Certaine it is that neither Boniface nor anie of his ſucceſſors euer either claimed or vſed in their publike acts or writings thetitle of vniuerſall Bishop: but rather all of them humble themſelues ſo farre as they ordinarilie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17282:73"/>ſtile themſelues no other then ſeruants of the ſeruants of God: howſoeuer that title &amp; ſtile might be offered them or vſed by others for their greater honor &amp; authoritie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Suppoſe Pope Boniface &amp; others his ſucceſſors had accepted &amp; vſed the title of vniuerſall Bishop I meane in a true ſenſe that is ſo as vniuerſall Bishop ſignifies onelie Bishop or paſtor of the vniuerſall Church, what great &amp; odious crime had this ben therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the name of Antichriſt, or vſurper of the ſupremicie in the vniuerſall Church, ſince that both the title of head of the vniuerſall Church, &amp; the authoritie alſo of the head was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto precedent Popes long before the time of Phocas,
<note place="margin">Iuſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſenior in epiſt. ad Io. 2. Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus epiſt. ad Theod. of <hi>Prima ſedes a nemine iudicatur.</hi> Vid. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. chal. in Epiſt. ad Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam. Vid. Act. 1. &amp; 3.</note> as doth appeare not onelie by the teſtimonies of two famous Emperours Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian &amp; valentinian, but alſo by the acts of the Chalcedon Councels that title is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in plaine termes. In ſo much that euen in thoſe prime ages it was turned in to a common prouerbe, that the firſt ſeat that is the Roman ſeat was to beiudged by noman.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie, If Pope Boniface is to be accounted Antichriſt by the profeſſors of the English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion becauſe they feigne him to haue vſurped the title &amp; power of vniuerſall Bishop, how I pray will their Kings eſcape the ſame cenſure who haue receiued the title, &amp; power of the head of the English Church from their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17282:74"/>King Henrie the 8. who neuertheleſſe had no more power (nay much leſſe) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it vpon them then the Emperour Phocas had to declare the ſame, or the like to be due to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Laſtelie. The truth is, that it is not founde in anie of the foreſaid hiſtoriographers or anie others of the Roman Religion, that Phocas gaue to the Pope eyther the power or yet the title of vniuerſall Bishop: but they relate onelie that Phocas by his imperial edict did declare againſt the preſumption of Iohn Patriarch of Conſtantinople that this title of head or Bishop of the vniuerſall Church was proper to the Bishop of Rome but not to him, or anie other: &amp; moreouer that it was no way due to the Bishops of the Conſtantinopolitan ſeat or Church. And this onelie the cited au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors relate without anie mention of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vniuerſall Bishop, but onelie they mention the wordes primate, prime ſeat, &amp; head of the Churches, or the like phraſes, as may be ſeene in their bookes. So that this is a groſſe impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Nouelliſts of our time in vſing the teſtimonies of theſe graue authors againſt the Popes of Rome by miere cheating, &amp; couſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: &amp; by this meanes in ſteed of prouing their intent they proue nothing els but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be miere Sycophants &amp; deceiuers, to whome ſuppoſing they publish to the world
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17282:74"/>the forſaid ſuppoſititious change of Religion made by Pope Boniface in the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, without either diuine or humane teſtimonie, more then their owne preſumed &amp; preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious authoritie, no prudent Chriſtian ought to giue anie more credit then he giues to the incredulous &amp; impious Iewes who calumniate Chriſt as a peruerter of the lawe of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he eſtablished his owne moſt perfect Church &amp; Religion in lieu of their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Synogog. And by this it is cleare that the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition of this my firſt argument ſtandes ſtill firme &amp; vnanſerable to wit that the Roman Religion onelie is &amp; euer was truelie Catholike, which is that I here intend to demonſtrate.</p>

               <p>MY fourth argument for poſitiue proofe of the Roman Religion is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>That Religion onely is true which hath a publike &amp; knowne rule of faith.</p>

                  </hi> to Roman Religion onely is the true Religion.</p>
               <p>Touching the filogiſme ther may ſeeme to be controuerſie betwixt vs &amp; the Noueliſts
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17282:80"/>both in the Maior &amp; the Minor wherefore I will proue them both ſeuerall tho' breefely as the nature of my diſputation requires.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition I proue aduertiſing the reader by the way that by a publike rule of faith I meane ſuch a rule as is cognoſcible or as may be knowne to all ſortes of people as well thoſe which are alreadie members of the true Church &amp; faith, as alſo to others who as yet being out of it deſire by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to be receiued into it.

               <p>It is a neceſſarie propertie of the true Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue a publike &amp; knowne rule of faith. Therefore the true Religion neceſſarily hath a Publike &amp; knowne rule of faith.</p>
               <p>The antecendent of the argument in which onely the difficultie of it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts, I proue becauſe if the true religion hath not a publike knowne rule of faith it is impoſſible for ſuch as want it to finde it in regarde that finding cannot be had but by ſeeking,
<note place="margin">quarite &amp; inuenietis.</note> &amp; to ſeeke or inquire for that which is not ſo publike that it can poſſible be found, is to ſeeke &amp; not to finde &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to labore in vaine. Now true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is of it owne nature ſuch as may befound by thoſe who endeuore to knowe it as day lie experience doth teach. And therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior ſaith: <hi>quaerite &amp; inuenietis,</hi> ſeeke &amp; you shall finde: which ſentence being generall, it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17282:81"/>cannot be more comodiouſlie vnderſtanded then of true Religion as being the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſſe which people can inquire for or ſeeke in this world as being the onelie way to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>minor</hi> of both my Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes which in ſubſtance are one &amp; the ſame propoſition, to wit that the Roman Religion onelie hath the neceſſarie propertie of a true Religion and not the English faith, that is a publike &amp; knowne rule of faith, it is moſt euident for that the rule of faith which the Roman Church propoſeth to be followed is the worde of God expounded by the publike, viſible, &amp; knowne authoritie of the Bishops &amp; Paſtors of the moſt vniuerſall Church in the manner &amp; forme aboue declared in my precedent demonſtration: And not as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the English Religion teach to wit by euerie priuate perſon in a ſenſe ſecret &amp; onelie knowne to him who hath it: &amp; which cannot poſſible be anie more vnderſtanded or perceiued by others then the moſt ſecret cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of an others mynde: All which as it plainelie appeareth is quite repugnant &amp; as it were doth directly intercept the meanes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God for the ſaluation of ſoules, who out of his infinit bountie &amp; mercie hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a way to Paradiſe ſo plaine &amp; perſpicious that euen children may be able to finde &amp;

If in the tyme of the old Teſtament ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were ſo frequent when God almightie conferred his giftes with a ſcarce &amp; ſparing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17282:84"/>deuotion &amp; perfection ought a ſacrifice to be offered in the lawe of Chriſt, which is by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie named the lawe of grace becauſe of the infinit abundance of graces, fauors, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which God powereth vpon thoſe who embrace the true faith &amp; Religion ſuppoſing that by how much the gifts be greater by ſo much the acknowledgment ought to be more exact &amp; accurate.</p>
               <p>Now for concluſion of my whole treatiſe I aduertice the reader that I haue put all my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in ſuch a forme of Sylogiſme as is moſt cleare &amp; obuious &amp; of that nature that if the premiſſes be once graunted for true, the conſequence moſt vndoubtedlie followes. They be alſo in a mode &amp; figure moſt knowne &amp; common. For theſe termes, <hi>that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> are to be accepted for a kynde of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal or indefinit ſubiect as ſignifying one among manie indeterminately, &amp; ſo euery Sylogiſme is in Darij, which both in mode &amp; figure is one of the plaineth formes. Which forme of argument I iudged moſt fit for my purpoſe in reſpect my cheefe deſigne in this matter is to conuince the vnderſtanding of the more intelligent &amp; ſcholaſticall ſorte of people in the truth of the Roman Religion, &amp; falſitie of the contrarie: who if they haue ſo much ingenuitie in them as to yeald to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17282:84"/>the truth when by iudicious meditation &amp; pondering of the premiſſes they shall finde it diſcouered &amp; ſet in their ſeight, I doubt not but they will perceiue themſelues by force of the conſequences concluded &amp; captiuated in obedience of faith, which is that onelie honor or profit I hope &amp; deſire to reape of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</p>
